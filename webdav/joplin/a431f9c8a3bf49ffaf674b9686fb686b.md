Scales

https://www.clarinetcloset.com/printable-scales/clarinet

I personally learned my scales by going around the circle of fifths. All of these are in concert pitch C -> G -> D -> A -> E -> B/C♭ -> F♯/G♭ -> D♭/C♯ -> A♭ -> E♭ -> B♭

you could also go backwards around the circle of fourths just start at C then go to B♭

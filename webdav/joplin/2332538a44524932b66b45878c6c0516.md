It's a great starting point for anyone wanting to learn more.\\\n\\\nHere is a bit more context about the game:\\\n\\\nI'm using GPT-3.5. The model simulates two people who play each other without any human intervention.\\\n\\\nI named the players Bob and Alice. They take turns playing tic tac toe. I wrote one prompt with the rules of the game.\\\n\\\nI wrote a Python function to check whether any of the players wins. I asked the model to call this function after every player's turn. OpenAI calls this feature \\\"function calling.\\\" This makes their model many times more powerful than before.\\\n\\\nThe model keeps track of the board. It knows what positions are available. I knew these models keep context and have memory, but I was still surprised when I got it working.\\\n\\\nFirst lesson\\\n\\\nDo not subestimate the capability of OpenAI models. They make many dumb mistakes, but they are still very powerful.\\\n\\\nThe entire game works with a single prompt. I'm proud of it, but it took a long time to get it right. 80% - 90% of my time building this sample went into the prompt.\\\n\\\nSecond lesson\\\n\\\nPrompting is finicky and unreliable. Even minor changes in the way you ask will lead to different results. Without reliability, this won't be the future of software development.\\\n\\\nWhen I finished building the game, I tried it using GPT-4. It doesn't work. Not even close.\\\n\\\nThird lesson\\\n\\\nThe lack of portability of prompts is a significant problem. Even minor changes in how a model works will break your applications. If we consider that building a good prompt is a large part of the work, this is a big issue.\\\n\\\nFinally, building anything beyond a simple demo is hard. I should have known better, but I waited too long before I started logging my chain of prompts.\\\n\\\nYou won't get too far if you can't experiment and \\\"debug\\\" your prompts and results.\\\n\\\nFourth lesson\\\n\\\nYou'll have to run hundreds or more experiments. Use a logging library that knows how to track Large Language Models. \\\n\\\nI'm using CometLLM, an open-source tool that works with CometML. (Disclosure: I’ve worked with CometML for a few years.) You can sign up for an account here:\\\ncomet.com/signup/?utm_so…\\\n\\\nHere is the source code of the game. 200 lines of code, half for tracking and debugging purposes:\\\n\\\ngithub.com/svpino/gpt-pla…\\\n\\\nWhat's your experience building applications with these models?\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":2497}]"

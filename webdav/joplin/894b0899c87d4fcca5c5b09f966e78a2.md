Masks

Wearing a #Covid-style mask for an extended period should be strongly avoided, especially among pregnant women and the very young. 

Legit research suggests the CO2 build-up is way, way higher than you or I might imagine.

Whoah indeed!
I read the source paper, seems legit. I was completely wrong, CO2 build-up is significant.
 
So wearing a mask for an extended period really should be avoided especially for pregnant women and the very young. 
Linking to Long Covid is still a big stretch.

"I'm strange", something like that. Maybe rhymes with "I'm mean", sounded like that somehow. My memory is very bad, normally write things down.

This afternoon, shopping in a supermarket, a tune came on the Tannoy.

Very cheesy, electronica, must have been from the last year or two. But made me happy, so clear on the awful supermarket ceiling speakers. I got phone out to do Shazam, wasn't online. Later it told me it hadn't got it.

It was quite awful pop music, but done well enough that it had me moving in the supermarket. On the most terrible speakers ever.

The production was brilliant to get it to play in that place. It really did sound good on supermaket speakers.

Was in Italy, but sounded totally in English. Could be Italians, don't think so.

If this rings a bell with anyone, please. So frustrating.

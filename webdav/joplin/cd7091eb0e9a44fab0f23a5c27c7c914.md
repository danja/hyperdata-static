For starters, the sub of DnB kicks is a bit higher than kicks from other EDM (40hz to around 70/80hz). You will be able to tell if your kick is good for DnB if it has a solid sound around 70 to 80 hertz; if you like the punch of a kick but it doesn't have that feature, try layering one that does underneath it.\\\n\\\nBut the other side of it is definitely getting a good balance in the mix; if you can get the kick to stand out without sidechaining it to the bass, you shouldn't have many problems. You want the transient of the kick to stand out but the low end of the kick to sound good together with the bass - neither should be overpowering the other.\\\n\\\nLike many have said before, the most important part about doing drums/percussion is selecting the right sample from the start. Listen carefully to kicks from other DnB tracks and keep those tracks handy when you're browsing for a kick to use so you can listen as a reference.\\\n\\\n----\\\n\\\nI'm going to say whoever is telling you to put a whole whack of ultra low frequencies into a kick drum (stuff around 50-60Hz) is giving you bad advice. Not if you want big booming basslines as well. You really have to pick one or the other, and in DnB it's the basslines that rule at the very bottom end. If you really want that bass out of your kickdrum, then you're going to have to sacrifice it from your bassline.\\\n\\\nThe only other trick you could do, would be to sidechain a compressor, or multiband compressor, to your bassline, and use the kick drum as a source. That would allow you to keep all of that nice juicy bass in all your instruments, but it's probably going to get messy, and sort of confusing to the ears.\\\n\\\nA good mid bass thump in a kick drum for DnB goes a long way.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\nTry Airwindows plugins (free). Specifically: Air2 for high frequency, density for thickness, and drumslam for punch.\\\n----\\\n\\\nIn dnb, especially older stuff, they’d filter the percussions (a slowly descending bandpass usually) to get “that” sound.\\\n\\\nYou can use ghost snares, hats, percs, the recording of you slapping a rats ass (see: koan sound)\\\n\\\nIt’s about the filters and the shuffle/swing.\\\n\\\nAnd compression.\\\n\\\n---\\\n\\\nOn the podcast tape notes— SG Lewis speaks about adding some high-passed distortion to his bass as many people listen to music today on AirPods/headphones. May not be a solution but something to think about\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":3046}]"

See here: [\\\\#42: Composite Video on an Analog Oscilloscope using XYZ - Lab tour...](https://youtu.be/5FYF5uhCzAM)\\\n\\\nAnother thing is the so called \\\"Arduino Graphics Interface\\\" (A.G.I.). This uses an Arduino Due and a daughter board to drive the scope and display whatever patterns you program.

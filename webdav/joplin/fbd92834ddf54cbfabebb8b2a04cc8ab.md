Eurorack

3U (5.06 inches or 128.5 mm), where height "U" is measured in rack units, rounded for a lip (nb: 3U in standard rack units would be 5.25 inches or 133.3 mm).

1HP (0.2 inches or 5.08 mm), where width "HP" is measured in horizontal pitch units. A card width is generally integer multiples of 1HP, although some manufactures work in multiples of 0.5HP.

Eurorack modules may be further characterized by depth: shallow modules (2.5 cm to 4 cm ) can fit into "skiff" cases and are casually referred to as "skiff friendly".

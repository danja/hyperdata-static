1. The walk


I was a little worried when Claudio started to pull on my leash. I couldn't see anything in the dark, but I knew the way back to the car. I had walked through these fields hundreds of times before, but never at night. The ground was uneven and I could feel stones poking through the bottom of my sneakers. Every now and then, I would stumble over something, but I always managed to keep my balance. After about ten minutes of walking, I reached the edge of the field and the car was just a few feet out of sight. The car was parked with the headlights shining on the road. I looked down at the ground and saw a small bush. I grasped the leash tightly and made my way to the bush. I crouched down, pulled the bush out of the way, and then stood up and saw Claudio sitting at the edge of the field, waiting for me.

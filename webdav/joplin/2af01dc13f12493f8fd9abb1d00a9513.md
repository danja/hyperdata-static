But with a big emphasis on the Maths. With computing.\\\n\\\n Add a very strong English. Not the way I/we were taught. Not sure I'd include any foreign languages, bring that under the English umbrella, global language, etymology. Maybe call it Language.\\\nI'd actually thin down the science to being one integrated subject (pumping Earth sciences, environment) maybe call it Reality (not joking). \\\nAnother umbrella subject, covering international history, politics, philosophy, RE (!) and everything including media & celebrities, call it Culture.\\\nOn the engineering side, I'd want to bring in what I had (fairly badly) as woodwork & metalwork, the hands-on angle. Where the engineering crosses over with DIY, life skills.\\\nAnd Creative. Art, music, writing. \\\nI'd probably pump music quite high there because it's not rich around abstract thought but there's also the affordances involved in learning an instrument, interacting with the environment.\\\nPE? Bugger that. The kids should be out playing in the streets.\\\n\\\nHmm. Is a good question :)\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1175}]"

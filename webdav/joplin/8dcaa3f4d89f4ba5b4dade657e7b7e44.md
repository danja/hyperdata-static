getting it to break up a project into components, tasks, and milestones, then output that as a [TODO.md](https://TODO.md) with "an outline of the project as you understand it" to aid memoization.

then work through those steps, marking them off as we go. At some point the model will go off on a tangent, so we recap the TODO file with the outline.

it can be a bit fussy outputing markdown, but the formatting is always good.

also, to avoid the excessive verbiage, i often say "express this following the guidelines in Strunks Elements of Style". pretty tight language, comments, docstrings etc.

I feel allowing GPT to read and update project docs -- README, TODO, etc -- will be quite powerful in the future. Not sure if any tools do that already?

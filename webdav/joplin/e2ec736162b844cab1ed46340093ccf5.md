Are Sky (satellite TV) boxes bendable?

I'm working on some music bits, thought it would be fun to add video. But although I'm familiar with analog & digital *audio* electronics, I haven't a clue about video. Love the glitchy vibe.

I saw the LoFi Future and nearby bits with feedback VGA-composite or whatever, and a dirty mixer somewhere. Has to be done, bits ordered. But I also had 20 year's worth of crap in the cantina to consider. Just dug it out. Still all untested, some may go boom!

But anyway, my newbie question is - has anyone got anything interesting out of a Sky box? For some reason I have 3 variants. 
Seems like they'd have all the output timing bits (looks like scart connectors, whatever protocol that is). Should be able to jam a signal in there somewhere..?

I really am clueless, any suggestions welcome.

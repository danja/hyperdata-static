Then lower the input level until it is limiting peaks of no more than 2-3dB.\\\n\\\nThis will roughly preserve your current mix.\\\n\\\nThe proper way to fix this is to mix it properly from the ground up, but this knowledge cannot be imparted in a Reddit post.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":484}]"

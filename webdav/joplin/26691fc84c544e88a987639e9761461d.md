For starters, the sub of DnB kicks is a bit higher than kicks from other EDM (40hz to around 70/80hz). You will be able to tell if your kick is good for DnB if it has a solid sound around 70 to 80 hertz; if you like the punch of a kick but it doesn't have that feature, try layering one that does underneath it.\\\n\\\nBut the other side of it is definitely getting a good balance in the mix; if you can get the kick to stand out without sidechaining it to the bass, you shouldn't have many problems. You want the transient of the kick to stand out but the low end of the kick to sound good together with the bass - neither should be overpowering the other.\\\n\\\nLike many have said before, the most important part about doing drums/percussion is selecting the right sample from the start. Listen carefully to kicks from other DnB tracks and keep those tracks handy when you're browsing for a kick to use so you can listen as a reference.\\\n\\\n----\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\"],[0,\"\\\n\"]],\"start1\":173,\"start2\":173,\"length1\":9,\"length2\":1563}]"

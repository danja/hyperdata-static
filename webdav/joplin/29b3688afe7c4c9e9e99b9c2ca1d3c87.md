I have a couple good resources for you:\\\n\\\nhttps://missing.csail.mit.edu\\\nThis one will teach you all about general computer skills, things like navigating the command line, bash scripting, cron scheduling, and make files which will be very useful to you.\\\n\\\nhttps://www.datacamp.com/courses/software-engineering-for-data-scientists-in-python\\\nThis one will teach you more python specific things like how to structure your code, best coding practices like DRY, and good docstrings.\\\n\\\nBoth of these really helped me and other people who I’ve recommended them too. Good luck!\\\n\\\nEDIT: to answer a couple of your questions (because I’m not sure the above resources cover this), you should starting using venv ASAP. Then pip freeze > requirements.txt (this will become clear when you understand what a venv is).\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":877}]"

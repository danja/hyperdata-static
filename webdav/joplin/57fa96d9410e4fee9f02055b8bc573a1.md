Reaper master leve

7dB is far too high. It will clip.

Some masters occasionally clip but by 0.1dB or so.

There's an easy way and a proper way to fix this.

The easy way is to add ReaLimiter to the master, set the ceiling to -0.5dB and enable true peak. Then lower the input level until it is limiting peaks of no more than 2-3dB.

This will roughly preserve your current mix.

The proper way to fix this is to mix it properly from the ground up, but this knowledge cannot be imparted in a Reddit post.

Auditory filter in MATLAB

Hi, what is the best way, in your opinion, to simulate the auditory filter in MATLAB?

I currently do this by spacing logarithmically 10 frequencies between 50 and 3500 Hz. Each frequency is the center frequency of a bandpass filter, similar to the auditory filter. But I don't think this is a good way to do it.

You're looking for a Gammatone filterbank.

You can easily implement them yourself as FIR filters, or download the auditory modelling toolbox, which contains a huge amount of functions for everything related to audio signal processing and to the modelling of the auditory system

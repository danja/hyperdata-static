And it's not based on Stable Diffusion! Finally something new.\\\n\\\nYou can find some examples with prompts & other parameters in my profile: [https://dreamlike.art/not\\\\_someone](https://dreamlike.art/not_someone)\\\n\\\nBesides txt2img, it can do image mixing like Midjourney or [lambda mixer model](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/image-mixer)! It's much better than the latter one though. I'm working right now on adding the image mixing to the website.\\\n\\\n![img](8rusaax9t1sa1)\"]],\"start1\":306,\"start2\":306,\"length1\":8,\"length2\":980}]"

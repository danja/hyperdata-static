Dubstep cheat

Professional dubstep "cheat sheet" a well known mixing/mastering engineer sent me:

all levels are of the final export (e.g. after master channel chain or whatever you have there)

Sub-Bass industry standard: -8DB, -7 to -8 DB for electronic music
Kick industry standard: -2DB after compression
Snare industry standard: 0DB (upto +10 overhead) 
White noise: -30 to -40 DB
Vocals: -3 DB
Hihats: -16 to -8 DB
Everything else: as quiet as you can keep it while maintaining it audible.

Kick, Snare & Sub-bass are always MONO. (Reverbs obviously stay stereo).

Rough EQ general chart:
Master channel lowpass 20hz & 18khz.
Sub cut 100hz.
Kick cut (if not sidechained) 75hz.
Hihats lowcut 5khz.
Vocals lowcut 250hz for male, higher for women
White noise lowcut 4khz
Everything else generally goes from 300-4000 overall (obviously use creative freedom).

Personally I'm not a fan of cheat sheets but the guy worked for some heavy hitters and told me he used those guidelines on every track he mixed/mastered.
I asked him about the level of the basses and he told me it's an industry secret, yesterday I saw a stream by Dirt Monkey and he kinda revealed that the professional levels for the basses is -2 db.

I won't give out the name cause I think he wouldn't like that but I'll say he worked for Noisia & Wubbaduck.

Hope that some of you will find this info useful ♥️

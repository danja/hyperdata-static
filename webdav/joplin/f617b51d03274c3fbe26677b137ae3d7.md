Mid Side

Achieving mid side processment in reaper is quite easy.
You create 3 tracks, one for the Bus, 1 for the MID and 1 for the side.

BUS TRACK - track 1
MID - track 2 going to BUS
SIDE - track 3 going to BUS

insert A1 stereoControl on track 2 and solo MID
insert A1 steroCOntrol on track 3 and solo SIDE

There you have your MID SIDE. There are other ways of doing,i do this way.

A1 stereocontrol is a free and very useful software!


All the rest has been said.
Reaper tracks are not mono, they can go up to 64 channels. AMAZING

Recording clarinet

I recently started learning clarinet, was surprised how very different a real one sounded compared to the synths (some of which do sound good, but as a totally different instrument).

Because I haven't learnt much, I thought I might be able to trick the ear with psychoacoustics. Easy bits played for real, hard bits on synth. I couldn't get it to work. Using synth as reinforcement of real does work pretty well for ambient/pad-like effects.

Btw, when experimenting with recording the thing I made a barrel mic. Boxwood turned on a lathe, I'd score myself 7/10 there (the 3 different internal diameters were really tricky). Drilled a hole in the side, 3mm I think. Tried a variety of small mic capsules/transducers, the best turned out to be a piezo crystal earpiece I got from eBay ages ago. 2/10 for getting a natural clarinet sound, it distorts really easily. *But*, the sound is actually really good! 
I'd compare it to the Kinks slashing a speaker cone for 'You Really Got Me'. Though I doubt it'll be launching a new genre any time soon :)

Now u have a 150mm frame and a 30x30 fc picked out.  I know u want to build but for the money you can’t touch the quality of the prebuilts price. You will get to learn to work on them when repairs are needed. At least you’ll get to fly buying a prebuilt.  There is a lot to learn besides picking the right parts. Soldering, wiring order, betaflight setup, radio set up.  Trust us when we try to steer you to elrs. It’s worth it over flysky. 20$ more and u can fly way farther than 100 yards and reception won’t be on your mind for you to worry about.\"]],\"start1\":85,\"start2\":85,\"length1\":12,\"length2\":702}]"

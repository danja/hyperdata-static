And so their brain is like: “yoo, what’s happening? This is too much for me, I’m out!”\\\n\\\nThe issue with not having a step by step process and not taking care of each single aspect separately is that your brain will be constantly trying to guess what’s the next thing it needs to take care of, and this will lead to confusion, stress and anxiety (and overall overwhelm).\\\n\\\nIt’s like having to go somewhere in town without knowing the itinerary, it’s stressful and you have to guess at each single turn. If you ever had to find a destination without a GPS in an unknown city in the middle of a traffic jam you know what I’m talking about!\\\n\\\nOn the contrary, if you can just turn on your gps, your analytic brain can just relax and you can put on some music and enjoy the ride. \\\n\\\nIt’s the same with music production. By developing a solid process for yourself you will have something that the monkey mind can focus on and this will take a lot of the stress off your shoulders.\\\n\\\nIf it can help, I can sum up my own process, here it is (more or less): \\\n\\\n1 - I always come up with a complete musical idea first;   \\\nIf I’m using samples and loops I make sure what I’m doing is musically complete (if I start with a vocal sample I will still make sure there is a chord progression that complements it for example). I want to have a main theme that can work for my track.  \\\nBasically, I take care of the composition first.\\\n\\\n2 - I really focus on selecting and designing solid sounds.  \\\nI want my sounds to be epic at this stage already: full, wide, punchy, clear, loud etc.   \\\nI don’t want to end up in the mix having to now make my song sound good; I prefer to get that out of the way at the source, designing my single elements properly from the start.\\\n\\\n3 - I take care of vertical arrangement and layering.   \\\nThis is one of the most creative phases where I add instruments and elements (including drums) and fill up the vertical space I have available (octaves or spectrum).  \\\nI then layer where needed to make sure I have a wide, huge sounding 8 bar loop that can stand out against pro tracks in the same genre.  \\\nAt this stage (and at the sound design one) I’m really crafting the sonic architecture of my track with the exact final result I want to hear in the master in mind.\\\n\\\n4 - I automate multiple parameters on most tracks to make sure my production sounds more alive.\\\n\\\n5 - Once my 8 or 16 bars loop is complete, I move onto my 2nd and 3rd section and run the same exact process (coherently with the first section I have created), I basically start arranging horizontally.   \\\nThe idea here is creating as much contrast as possible between the sections while still making them relevant to each other.   \\\nThis way people will stay engaged throughout the track as they’ll have something different to listen to.\\\n\\\n6 - I add transitions, sound FX and ear candy to make the track flow even better and to make it even more captivating to the ear.\\\n\\\n7 - Once I have all sections of my track down I scan it from start to finish and fix all the little things that pop out to my ear. \\\n\\\nAt that point I’m ready to export the stems for my own mixing project (which I do separately, to have a fresh and clear perspective as to what I need to do).\\\n\\\nAnd this is a very quick overview of my process, you don’t need to use the same exact things but my suggestion for today is, especially if you struggle with overwhelm and procrastination, make it easier for yourself: Define your process, break it down in smaller chunks and allow your brain to focus on one thing at a time.  \\\nOnly worry about the next step once you know you have the previous one down!\\\n\\\nThis should make it easier and allow you to relax and find that creative joy again, hope this helps, let me know what you think about it in the comments :)\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":5391}]"

I don't use the Z-axis for oscilloscope music, but I still want to mention some other things you could do with blanking:

With the help of blanking you can build a circuit, that lets the scope basically function like a TV where you can display ordinary analog video. See here: [\#42: Composite Video on an Analog Oscilloscope using XYZ - Lab tour...](https://youtu.be/5FYF5uhCzAM)

Another thing is the so called "Arduino Graphics Interface" (A.G.I.). This uses an Arduino Due and a daughter board to drive the scope and display whatever patterns you program. Have a look here: [https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/the-arduino-graphics-interface-part-1](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/the-arduino-graphics-interface-part-1)

Also shameless self-promotion demonstrating the A.G.I.: [Playing Games on an Oscilloscope | Arduino Graphics Interface](https://youtu.be/WlYm5UC8X8Q)

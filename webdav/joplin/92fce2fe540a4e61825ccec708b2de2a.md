My mixing and mastering process is a recipe I've developed over the years through trial and error:

* Vox are processed with EQ and an LA-2A while tracking; high pass at 80 Hz, spritz with verb and delay in the mix
* Find the level I want the vox (hook/chorus, verses, etc.) to sit in the mix
* Bring in the bass and kick and adjust until they're in balance with the vox
* Bring in the snare and adjust until balanced
* Bring in the hats and adjust until balanced (pan, add verb or delay if necessary)
* Bring in other percussion elements and adjust until balanced - (pan, add verb or delay if necessary)
* Listen to the mix; analyze; watch what the meter is doing; make adjustments as needed
* Bring in the main melody element and adjust until balanced
* Bring in supporting elements and adjust until balanced - (pan, add verb or delay if necessary)
* Take a break
* Listen to the mix; watch the meter to ensure consistency in the mix across the whole song; make adjustments as needed

My mastering process is just a preset with an EQ, compressor, and maximizer in the chain. If the mix is solid, I have a good idea of what it'll sound like when I run it through the mastering process. I'm not using the mastering process to fix anything. I'm using it enhance and glue everything together for a pleasant listening experience across all devices. My final listening decision is made in the car. If it hits and is well balanced, then I call it wrap.

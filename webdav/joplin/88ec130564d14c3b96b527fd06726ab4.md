Design

convolutional autoencoders, variational autoencoders, and denoising autoencoders

Variational take a continuous view of the latent space, sounds about right for seismo

Clockwork does video prediction

Port to pytorch? With the help of ChatGPT!

Translate the following code from X to y : ...

But there is a limit to the length of content it can parse at once.  On the output side, you can often just tell it to continue.  But you can't provide input in such a long length.  Here I'm defining long as maybe a printed page if the lines aren't long.  I think someone had calculated its limits somewhere between 4k and 8k (not for code).

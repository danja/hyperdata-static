World inaction

Verse 1:
Hey there humanity, what have you done?
My rivers are poisoned, my air is undone
I'm feeling weak, can't you see?
Your actions are killing me

Chorus:
Why won't you hear my plight?
Why won't you make things right?
The damage you've caused, it's no small fight
Please help me heal, with all your might

Verse 2:
You drill for oil, you strip the land
Your greed is causing so much harm
The temperatures rise, the storms grow strong
And still you continue on

Chorus:
Why won't you hear my plight?
Why won't you make things right?
The damage you've caused, it's no small fight
Please help me heal, with all your might

Bridge:
It's up to you to make a change
To heal the wounds, to break the chains
Let's work together, side by side
To save this planet, let's turn the tide

Chorus:
Why won't you hear my plight?
Why won't you make things right?
The damage you've caused, it's no small fight
Please help me heal, with all your might

Outro:
The time to act is now, my friend
Let's work together to make amends
For every living creature, every tree and every stream
Let's heal this planet, let's make it a dream.

Scales

The "primary" scale of Arabic maqam music is the scale for maqam Rast, which goes C D Ed F G A Bd C (the d means half-flat), where the B note can vary somewhat.  It's primary in the same way that the diatonic scale is primary in Western music, as the common set of notes for a variety of modes, but somewhat less so; the diatonic scale itself is also used, as are scales with augmented seconds.  The rotations of maqam Rast are quite important: with mostly the same notes, you have the scales for maqam Iraq (starting on Bd), Bayati (starting on D), Sikah (starting on Ed), and Jiharkah (starting on F).  Nawa (starting on G) too, but that's an older maqam that's not part of the current Arabic system but is still present in Sephardic liturgy.  I don't remember if there's something on the A; I think there isn't since it wouldn't have a fifth.

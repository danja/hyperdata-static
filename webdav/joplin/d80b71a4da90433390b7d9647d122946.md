I don't currently have a design for it yet, but these are the ideas I have for it so far:\\\n\\\n* The app always has the current time\\\n* You can create tasks and add the time it should take to complete them.\\\n* You should be able to automate adding tasks everyday, or a certain day of the week. Like \\\"Mop floor\\\" set to \\\"Every Monday\\\".\\\n* A way to see if you are on schedule with the tasks which need to be done.\\\n* An algorithm that can prioritize tasks based on a set timeframe. For example, it could sort tasks by the largest tasks that can be completedwithin an hour.\\\n* Compare how long a task took with the estimate given.\\\n\\\nI know that there are already some ADHD apps out there, but most of them you have to pay for. I've even seen some where you need to pay for a subscription! I want to open source this app so that it can be free, easily accessible, and hopefully maintained by the community.\\\n\\\nAre there any other features that would be useful for an app for ADHD?\\\n\\\nEdit: Thanks for all the replies everyone! I see that something everyone is asking for is a gamifacation system. If anyone has any ideas on gamifcation let me know.\\\n\\\n---\"],[0,\"\\\n\\\nhttps:\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":8,\"length2\":1258}]"

Sure, you have things like

\- GIMP (Photoshop)

\- Inkscape (Illustrator)

\- Darktable (Lightroom)

\- KDEnlive, Shotcut, Openshot (Premiere Pro)

\- Natron (After Effects)

but they aren't really alternatives (except Natron and Premiere Alternatives, very sophisticated, although Natron is difficult to learn), are they?

  
GIMP lacks some basic tools like creating shapes, content-aware fill etc.

Inkscape also lacks essential tools like generating stars, donuts, etc. and the automatic layers.

Darktable lacks some advanced tools, although they aren't essential (Talking about lens flare generators, god rays, etc.)

&#x200B;

In addition, especially GIMP and Inkscape lack good UX design. Adobe and, even more, Serif Labs, have done a way better job in designing their software intuitively and eye-pleasing.

I really do want to enjoy working with Libre & Open Source Software, but the design of the products just makes it impossible to me.

&#x200B;

I don't want to shoot against the developers or anything, they are hard working and skilled individuals and I truly appreciate all the efforts that they've put into all these FLOSS projects.

But it could be so much better.

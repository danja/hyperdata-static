Python waveform

What is it for?

u/steve_duda has given *the* answer, but how I'd approach it personally :

As a quick approximation, subtractively - it looks kinda triangular but without detail, so I'd take a triangle wave and LP + whatever filter and tweak until it sounded near enough. 
(Steve's counting says it's only odd harmonics, as are triangles, but it does need all but a few multipliers to be zero.)

To do it more accurately...I've no doubt got an additive synth or two nearby in the box, but I've no idea what or where. I've been up to my eyeballs in non-music Python code recently, so if I wanted this precisely today I'd do it in code. Make a loop to step through the desired sample time. Add together a few a*sin(b*t) components. Use the python Wave library or somesuch with a bit of boilerplate to render it to wav

Not if you want big booming basslines as well. You really have to pick one or the other, and in DnB it's the basslines that rule at the very bottom end. If you really want that bass out of your kickdrum, then you're going to have to sacrifice it from your bassline.\\\n\\\nThe only other trick you could do, would be to sidechain a compressor, or multiband compressor, to your bassline, and use the kick drum as a source. That would allow you to keep all of that nice juicy bass in all your instruments, but it's probably going to get messy, and sort of confusing to the ears.\\\n\\\nA good mid bass thump in a kick drum for DnB goes a long way.\\\n\\\n----\\\n\\\nIn dnb, especially older stuff, they’d filter the percussions (a slowly descending bandpass usually) to get “that” sound.\\\n\\\nYou can use ghost snares, hats, percs, the recording of you slapping a rats ass (see: koan sound)\\\n\\\nIt’s about the filters and the shuffle/swing.\\\n\\\nAnd compression.\\\n\"],[0,\"\\\n\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":1725,\"start2\":1725,\"length1\":11,\"length2\":1090}]"

After months messing with Stable Diffusion, very little depends on the prompt, most of the work is inpainting, img2img, controlnet and choosing the best checkpoint for each case. But in chatgpt it is different, prompt matters more and when I see "prompt engineering curse" it's for it.

Here's the safetensors version (Won't work with current code in the github repo, you'll have to modify it): [https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/kandinsky-2.1](https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/kandinsky-2.1)

Kandinsky 2.1 is a brand new (released <24h ago) open source image generation model. And it's not based on Stable Diffusion! Finally something new.

You can find some examples with prompts & other parameters in my profile: [https://dreamlike.art/not\_someone](https://dreamlike.art/not_someone)

Besides txt2img, it can do image mixing like Midjourney or [lambda mixer model](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/image-mixer)! It's much better than the latter one though. I'm working right now on adding the image mixing to the website.

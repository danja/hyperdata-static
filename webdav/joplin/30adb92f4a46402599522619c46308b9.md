Sentences

Fwiw, I agree about the semweb not having failed, but it's like it's grown linearly in the background rather than the exp front &

I'm struggling nearby, around where the semweb relies on fixed terms in statements, hard to pin down in LLMs. But there's a lot of data already encoded with typed links, and the whole web with looser links. All can be seen as sentences, a strong parallel to language models.

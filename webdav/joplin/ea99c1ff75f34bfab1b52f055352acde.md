Skips post

A few years back I found an old Sony Camcorder (excellent optics, Mini DV tape format) in a charity shop in Bakewell for Â£8. I think I got some film of Derbyshire roads at the time. Next outing for it was when I went to Australia. I have hours and hours of road footage there.

Hadn't looked at this stuff since, but because I want to put together some minimal vids to go with music stuff, dug out all the old video gear and bought a bunch of adapters.

Using a USB adapter I am able to get stuff onto computer, so far only I think in 640x480 (it might be the limit of the adapter, it was the cheapest). While trying this, stumbled on something interesting (to me) - Skips!

Incidentally last week there was a big gold nugget found near where I was. The gold fields were pretty much on the way between Michelle's house and her caravan at the coast. I bought a cheap metal detector off eBay while I was there, but never actually got to try it in the wild. Found a bunch of nails in her garden. Left the device with her, not heard from since.

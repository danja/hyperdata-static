Prompt

I'm using below instructions. Nothing fancy. Just covers the minor annoyances along with forcing it to make a plan which gives it space to think before committing to a particular path:

"When coding related tasks are given, do not write code right away. First plan on what steps are needed to solve the problem in a terse manner. note down your thoughts and then start writing code. unless asked for explanations, don't provide one about the written code or mention about logging or error handling or any other non functional requirements. Unless otherwise mentioned, always print back the whole code including modifications."

<p>Ok, so I've had something of a look around the Kendraio material. Not as much as I'd hoped, with perfect timing a bunch of distractions appeared (notably trying to sort out a new ID card, thanks Brexit, and my server <em>may</em> have been hacked, broken Wordpress - ok for now, had a recent backup, but still haven't got to the bottom of it).</p>

<p>Very interesting! I would very much like to join you.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that for you to be able to think of a possible role for me, I'd better give you some idea of the kind of things I can do, see where I might fit in with the rest of the team. So a CV-ish thing below, hopefully I got the relevant bits.</p>

<p>Before anything else I must say that I'm absolutely behind your philosophy. I'm a big fan of open source, open data etc. I have worked quite happily in commercial orgs (and a college), but there is something nice about a non-profit.</p>

<p>Part-time working suits me best - my productivity tends to take a nosedive after the equiv. of say 25 hours a week.</p>

<p>Regarding payment, I've no problem with it being relatively low against industry standards, I don't exactly have an extravagent lifestyle.</p>

<p>I would prefer to be in something long-term, the hassle (mostly cognitive) of hopping between different projects I've been doing does get a bit tiring.</p>

<h2>First Impressions</h2>

<p>The Kendraio site is spot on. I really can't fault it at all.</p>

<p>There's an astonishing amount of material in the codebase.</p>

<p>The app ran fine. Though as a new user it was a bit intimidating, and I haven't got it doing anything useful for me yet. I think that should be easy to do. There's clearly more than <em>Minimum Viable Product</em> in the codebase, just it isn't pushed forward.</p>

<p>That I'd strongly recommend : getting it to do <em>something</em> very visible out of the box. Maybe pre-load it with YouTube Adaptor, so all a person has to do is enter their credentials and they have access through the API. Not sure what's the next most likely service someone might have, but have that lined up, like through a Wizard maybe.</p>

<p>Regarding non-core ideas, off the top of my head I would definitely consider looking into what's available as low-hanging fruit around RDF/Linked Data services etc. (I'm not the zealot I once was with this stuff, but it can be very useful, worth a look).
Also 'monitoring yourself' might be a useful avenue : a feedreader kind of thing, tracking mentions on twitter etc. (I did make <a href="https://danja.github.io/NewsMonitor/NewsMonitorSpecification_2014-04-18.html">a feedreader</a>, years back, is familiar territory).</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>I live in a rural hamlet called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CimUVuJ5qFNwnFPs7">Mozzanella</a>, about 2 hours north of Pisa.</p>

<p>I've been here about 20 years, though my Italian is still terrible. I live alone with a dog called Claudio (have girlfriend in a nearby town, she has cats).</p>

<p>I'm 58 years old, aspire to a chilled life but am very much into Web development etc. I own my own house, no car, so my cost of living is relatively low. The past few years I've been getting by with occasional short-term coding contracts (often for acquaintances that have over-committed on their own contracts, pulling me in informally so they could cover more ground).</p>

<p>I'm reasonably healthy, physically and mentally (ok, at least nothing too pathological: slight belly - too much beer; prone to anxiety, rather disorderly attention).</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>I'm definitely not a <em>great</em> coder, but have been doing it long enough that I'm <em>good enough</em> for most things. Agnostic over choice of language, whatever's appropriate to the task. Probably spent most time with Java, though haven't done any in a long while. Familiar with most Web tech, 'full-stack'-ish. I've got a virtual server with <a href="https://hyperdata.it/">blog etc</a>, couple of little services. The <a href="https://hyperdata.it/webbeep/">beep thing</a> is fun.</p>

<p>I don't know Typescript, I do need to learn. I suppose I know a bit of the theory around cryptocurrencies, but in practice you might as well consider me a blank slate.</p>

<p>I did do something with AngularJS some years ago, <a href="https://github.com/danja/angular-rdf">some RDF binding stuff</a> :
For a learning exercise I reckon I'll update that soon for modern Angular with Typescript.</p>

<p>The last little work contract I had was a natural language processing thing, using Python and <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> (a very handy little framework, simplifies a lot of the tricky machine learning bits).
I tend to have lots of projects on the go at any given time, hop between them. Examples -</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://hyperdata.it/blog/2022/09/04/dreamachine-3-progress/">Dreamachine</a> : flashy-lights hardware gadget, embedded C++</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://hyperdata.it/kodaly/capture/capture.html">Kodaly hand signals</a> : a little machine learning experiment, I've got as far as a browser Javascript app for capturing images (main motivation is to get familiar with the Deep Learning tools for a <a href="https://elfquake.wordpress.com/about/">more ambitious project</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>SparqlPress : a Linked Data plugin for Wordpress, PHP + RDF etc. I was prompted to start on it as a mini-contract to revive an old project, but now I want to continue in my own time. It doesn't really do anything useful yet, is currently on pause. I think the idea is great, but I don't like the way I was implementing it, clunky architecture. Need to rethink.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have been involved with standards orgs - mostly W3C (on some RDF bits).</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>I did spend a decade mostly working on tech books (writing, editorial/reviewing). What was best (and most challenging) about that was I was often asked to write/review material that I knew nothing about, so had to learn fast. Also meant I could work from home - how I ended up overseas.</p>

<p>I was a fairly compulsive blogger, back in the day : mostly evangelising Semantic Web stuff. Still doing it, but a lot more relaxed about it now.</p>

<p>I've had a hand in a few academic papers : https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=danny+ayers
Spoken at quite a few conferences.</p>

<p>I worked for a couple of years for <a href="https://talis.com/">Talis</a>, 'community outreach manager' or somesuch. Birmingham company though I was working full-time from here, would visit every couple of months. My brief there was mostly just to make things using their (Semantic Web) cloud platform, blog about it. Was good stuff, easy to promote because I liked it. But alas the company reorganised, more money in flogging their (dull) educational software than doing a Blue Sky kind of research project.</p>

<p>I've recently started trying to figure out how to make <em>watchable</em> YouTube videos. Always had a bit of interest (from music videos I guess) but with the growth of YouTube and the availability of the tools nowadays, seems like a natural progress from blogging. Long way to go yet, but gradually getting the hang.</p>

<p>But my main hobby is the music stuff. I'm a lousy guitar &amp; keyboard player with a rough voice (recently started learning clarinet, so also bad at that). But <strong>computer</strong>!
The material I'm most satisfied with is from a creative burst years ago, is over on Soundcloud, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/danny-ayers/bittersweet-danny">eg</a>.</p>

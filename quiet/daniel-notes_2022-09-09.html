<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>I live in a very rural hamlet called Mozzanella, about 2 hours north of Pisa.

I've been here about 20 years, though my Italian is still terrible. I live alone with a dog called Claudio (have girlfriend in a nearby town, she has cats).</p>

<p>I'm 58 years old, aspire to a chilled life but am very much into Web development etc. I own my own house, no car, so my cost of living is relatively low. The past few years I've been getting by with occasional short-term coding contracts (often for acquaintances that have over-committed on their own contracts, pulling me in informally so they could cover more ground).</p>

<p>I'm reasonably healthy, physically and mentally (ok, not exactly fit, slight belly; prone to anxiety, rather disorderly attention).</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>I'm definitely not a <em>great</em> coder, but have been doing it long enough that I'm <em>good enough</em> for most things. Agnostic over choice of language, whatever's appropriate. Probably spent most time with Java, though haven't done any in a while. Familiar with most Web tech, 'full-stack'-ish. I've got a virtual server up at https://hyperdata.it/ with blog etc, couple of little services. The beep thing is fun :</p>

<p>The last little work contract I had was a natural language processing thing, using Python and spaCy (a very handy little framework, simplifies a lot of the tricky machine learning bits).
I tend to have lots of projects on the go at any given time, hop between them. Examples -</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dreamachine : flashy-lights hardware gadget, embedded C++, https://hyperdata.it/blog/2022/09/04/dreamachine-3-progress/</p></li>
<li><p>Kodaly hand signals : a little machine learning experiment, I've got as far as a browser Javascript app for capturing images, https://hyperdata.it/kodaly/capture/capture.html</p></li>
<li><p>SparqlPress : a Linked Data plugin for Wordpress, PHP + RDF etc. I was prompted to start on it as a mini-contract to revive an old project, but now I want to continue in my own time. It doesn't really do anything useful yet, is currently on pause. I think the idea is great, but I don't like the way I was implementing it, clunky architecture. Need to rethink.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know Typescript, I do need to learn.</p>

<p>I did do something with AngularJS some years ago, some RDF binding stuff : https://github.com/danja/angular-rdf
For a learning exercise I reckon I'll update that soon for modern Angular with Typescript.</p>

Ok, so I've had something of a look around the Kendraio material. Not as much as I'd hoped, with perfect timing a bunch of distractions appeared (notably trying to sort out a new ID card, thanks Brexit, and my server _may_ have been hacked, broken Wordpress - ok for now, had a recent backup, but still haven't got to the bottom of it).

Very interesting! I would very much like to join you.

It occurs to me that for you to be able to think of a possible role for me, I'd better give you some idea of the kind of things I can do, see where I might fit in with the rest of the team. So a CV-ish thing below, hopefully I got the relevant bits.

Before anything else I must say that I'm absolutely behind your philosophy. I'm a big fan of open source, open data etc. I have worked quite happily in commercial orgs (and a college), but there is something nice about a non-profit.

Part-time working suits me best - my productivity tends to take a nosedive after the equiv. of say 25 hours a week.

Regarding payment, I've no problem with it being relatively low against industry standards, I don't exactly have an extravagent lifestyle.

I would prefer to be in something long-term, the hassle (mostly cognitive) of hopping between different projects I've been doing does get a bit tiring.

## First Impressions

The Kendraio site is spot on. I really can't fault it at all.

Monitoring yourself : a feedreader kind of things, tracking mentions etc.

## Personal

I live in a rural hamlet called [Mozzanella](https://goo.gl/maps/CimUVuJ5qFNwnFPs7), about 2 hours north of Pisa.

I've been here about 20 years, though my Italian is still terrible. I live alone with a dog called Claudio (have girlfriend in a nearby town, she has cats).

I'm 58 years old, aspire to a chilled life but am very much into Web development etc. I own my own house, no car, so my cost of living is relatively low. The past few years I've been getting by with occasional short-term coding contracts (often for acquaintances that have over-committed on their own contracts, pulling me in informally so they could cover more ground).

I'm reasonably healthy, physically and mentally (ok, at least nothing too pathological: slight belly - too much beer; prone to anxiety, rather disorderly attention).

## Coding

I'm definitely not a _great_ coder, but have been doing it long enough that I'm _good enough_ for most things. Agnostic over choice of language, whatever's appropriate to the task. Probably spent most time with Java, though haven't done any in a long while. Familiar with most Web tech, 'full-stack'-ish. I've got a virtual server with [blog etc](https://hyperdata.it/), couple of little services. The [beep thing](https://hyperdata.it/webbeep/) is fun.

I don't know Typescript, I do need to learn. I suppose I know a bit of the theory around cryptocurrencies, but in practice you might as well consider me a blank slate.

I did do something with AngularJS some years ago, [some RDF binding stuff](https://github.com/danja/angular-rdf) :
For a learning exercise I reckon I'll update that soon for modern Angular with Typescript.

The last little work contract I had was a natural language processing thing, using Python and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (a very handy little framework, simplifies a lot of the tricky machine learning bits).
I tend to have lots of projects on the go at any given time, hop between them. Examples -

- [Dreamachine](https://hyperdata.it/blog/2022/09/04/dreamachine-3-progress/) : flashy-lights hardware gadget, embedded C++

- [Kodaly hand signals](https://hyperdata.it/kodaly/capture/capture.html) : a little machine learning experiment, I've got as far as a browser Javascript app for capturing images (main motivation is to get familiar with the Deep Learning tools for a [more ambitious project](https://elfquake.wordpress.com/about/))

- SparqlPress : a Linked Data plugin for Wordpress, PHP + RDF etc. I was prompted to start on it as a mini-contract to revive an old project, but now I want to continue in my own time. It doesn't really do anything useful yet, is currently on pause. I think the idea is great, but I don't like the way I was implementing it, clunky architecture. Need to rethink.

I have been involved with standards orgs - mostly W3C (on some RDF bits).

## Media

I did spend a decade mostly working on tech books (writing, editorial/reviewing). What was best (and most challenging) about that was I was often asked to write/review material that I knew nothing about, so had to learn fast. Also meant I could work from home - how I ended up overseas.

I was a fairly compulsive blogger, back in the day : mostly evangelising Semantic Web stuff. Still doing it, but a lot more relaxed about it now.

I've had a hand in a few academic papers : https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=danny+ayers
Spoken at quite a few conferences.

I've recently started trying to figure out how to make _watchable_ YouTube videos. Always had a bit of interest (from music videos I guess) but with the growth of YouTube and the availability of the tools nowadays, seems like a natural progress from blogging.

But my main hobby is the music stuff. I'm a lousy guitar & keyboard player with a rough voice (recently started learning clarinet, so also bad at that). But **computer**!

1. get all info together on page (including sensible pricing, to let + sell...)
2. do any pressing jobs (clear cantine, clean around)
3. promote on social media, leaflets?
4. add to any free estate agent sites
[give it a little time]
5. (maybe) talk to Brunello (Brunello Orsetti, I think, had to look up, who we bought No.7 off) - Agenzia Il Parco Immobiliare, Castelnuovo
6. (maybe) talk to Fabrizio in Castiglione

Current "AI" is an easier (though often obtuse due to alignment issues) interface to a grab bag of machine learning algorithms (and their limitations)
But as usual we're being dragged down by "sci fi" expectations, rather than grounded expectations.
Â«Please note that these techniques won't "enhance" the image in the same way forensic tools might be portrayed in media; they can only work within the limitations of the existing image data.Â»
I didn't even use the word "enhance," I said "please generate a clearer image of the cat," but it presumed that's where I was coming from.
And it spends about Â¾ of its text explaining why it doesn't meet sci-fi expectations.

Thanks David, the way you put that nicely pins down something I've been trying to find words for.
Folks like Kingsley (@kidehen on Twitter) have been saying something very similar but in relation to Linked Data : LLMs offer a human-friendly interface to such knowledgebases. Currently there's a lot of focus is around RAG, because it's very ripe low-hanging fruit. But in the same region there's the elephant of Web-oriented distributed systems, and the agent paradigm comes out of hibernation (sorry, daft metaphors just appear around this stuff ðŸ™‚
Your "grab bag" of ML algorithms slots in nicely there.

[I'm slowly getting things together to have a play around these parts. A zoo of small (possibly task-specific) models, very loosely-coupled. Same environment, well, anything - the ML grab bag, interfaces to web search, Linked Data, reasoners... Prompted by danbri I'm looking at using XMPP (Jabber) multi-user chat for wiring. It's not really web-native, but near enough - its JIDs are very similar to URIs, which I reckon have to be kinda the grounding points. Pragmatically, there are loads of clients available off the shelf and the chat aspect is bang on for LLMs & chatty humans.

I've played a lot with ML-ish stuff over the years but totally had my eye of the ball when transformers came along. I've a lot to learn! But these bits ^^^ are in reasonably familiar territory, so it gives me a foothold.]

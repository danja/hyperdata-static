I only heard of your book today, I'll check it out soon.
I really like Dean Allemang & co's "Sem Web for the Working Ontologist" book (even though the title isn't great!).

Sarker Bishnu : Joint Forces of LLM and KG for biomedical Knowledge Discovery
using AI with gene ontologies/lots of data for DNA/RNA seq -> protein prediction

I don't know your field at all, there's an elemental bit I don't know :
You led up to transformers nicely.
your explanation of N-gram vs. neural models showed how having a way of knowing the similarity between cat & dog is very useful.

But going back a step, historical work, why can't you use a logical reasoner?
This chunk of the genome generates this compound that will take this place in a protein

he said protein stuff is multimodal

Yes, your presentation was very useful, thank you. Years ago I was quite involved in product dev in a medium-sized business, but since I've only done contract coding/freelance consultancy. Interesting to see how LLMs influence the dev cycles etc.

The Kingsley Idehen (@kidehen) agent-related posts I mentioned are around -https://twitter.com/kidehen/status/1721888379435102706
(I (@danja) forwarded this to Robert Scoble (@scobleizer), an industry analyst I respect a lot (he used to be a tech evangelist for MS so knows that perspective, but is also very open-minded and genuinely enthusiastic about new tech)

Knowledge Graph Treatments for Hallucinating LLMs

bang-on material for RDF+LLMs

Very interesting research,
The tools you showed nicely how they tools look great!

I've been exploring RDF plus LLMs space, like, I recently wrote a proof-of-concept SPARQL connector for RAG in LlamaIndex.But I'm curious about addressing the models more directly - vaguely around the slide about fusing text & graphs. Getting the models to understand the more knowledge in graph structures , beyond the serial kind

Ok, tied to a big external model like GPT3

But practical obstacles - I can't afford much GPU time - so thinking about very small models from scratch or fine tuning heavily quantized base models.

Do you think that given very domain-specific, curated training data in smaller models, some kind of orchestration might be a way of

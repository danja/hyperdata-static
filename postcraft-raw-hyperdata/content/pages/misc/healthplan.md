New Year's Resolutions are a non-starter for me. But it's 2024-01-01 today, so seems a good time to note

Similarly I find most of the popular health & fitness activities inconceivable. Sport has negative appeal. The college I worked at years back had a gym, which I visited 3 times. First time, interesting. The woman that ran it, who was lovely, good fun, showed me around the equipment. 2nd time there was the novelty of a proper session using the stuff. Third time I was bored to tears. Reverted to having a pint after work.

I think you know me well enough, I avoid promoting commercial things like the plague. But I feel obliged to recommend @Linode for hosting. I've used them for a few years, virtual server (mine is Ubuntu in a London datacentre). First chosen because they were the cheapest with a good reputation. Since, just worked. Until my server recently got compromised. My bad, I'd never even been looking at the ball. But I've been gobsmacked by their support. Their online docs are relatively good and the responses to me have been as immediate as realistic. But just *outstanding* personalized help. Very friendly, very clear with the tech. Even obscure things that turned out not to be directly related to the problem at hand, this guy spent time checking, reported back explaining in a way I could understand. 
So although I've no idea how they compare to the rest of the market now in day-to-day $s, I doubt you'll find any service provider easier on your mental health.

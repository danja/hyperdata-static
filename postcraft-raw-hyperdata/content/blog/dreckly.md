I was about to post commenting on the irony that English evolved under England's weather but doesn't have enough words for rain.
Today it was somewhere between drizzle and spotting here. To avoid being the stereotypical Englishman, ie. grumbling and remaining ignorant, I asked ChatGPT.
'Scotch Mist'! Yup, I'd forgotten that one, is near enough. A nice choice given that for historical reasons there are a lot of Scottish people here in Garfagnana.
(Correct me if I'm wrong, but the nearest Italian word would seem to be 'pioggerella', diminuitive of 'pioggia', rain. New to me, has a nice ring to it).
But I was irked that it was 'Scotch Mist' when I should have known a Tidza dialect word for it. So asked ChatGPT to make one up.
What it came up with, 'dreichle', explained below, but I'm going to adjust because it seems far too complicated and Germanic (especially with 'reich' in the middle). 
But nearby, 'dreckle' looks good. 
It works nicely as a noun : 
"The morning was greeted with a soft dreckle that coated the cobblestones."
& verb :
"It started to dreckle just as we stepped outside, gentle enough to forego umbrellas."
 'dreckling' is there as gerund/adjective/present participle, also kinda sweet as a continuous verb :
"The skies were dreckling softly as the festival began, adding a magical touch to the atmosphere."
Where it gets fun is as 'dreckly', which can be an adverb : 
"The fog settled dreckly over the landscape, enveloping everything in a soft, wet haze." 
& adjective :
"The day was dreckly, with a fine mist that hung in the air, blurring the distant hills."
The fun is that Cornish already has 'dreckly' (which I learnt from oor Nigel, who lives over there). It comes from 'directly' for 'soon', but usually means 'at some unspecified time in the future'.
And now we have the universal UK weather forecast : "dreckly dreckly".

Word: **"Dreichle"**
### Etymology:
The term "Dreichle" is a whimsical concoction that draws its roots from a blend of local dialect and imaginative folklore, nestled in the heart of Tideswell, Derbyshire. Deriving its essence from the word "dreich," a term borrowed from Scots language to describe dreary, drizzly weather, combined with a playful twist from the local vernacular, "le," a diminutive suffix suggesting something small or light, "Dreichle" encapsulates the peculiar blend of mist and light rain that characterizes a "Scotch Mist" without directly referencing geography.
The story goes that many moons ago, a peculiar weather pattern often swept over Tideswell, leaving the villagers to ponder the misty drizzle that was neither here nor there. It was said to be the work of a mischievous spirit, Dreichle, who couldn't decide whether to water the earth or merely tease it with a spectral caress. Thus, the spirit's indecision manifested as this peculiar precipitation, too light to be called rain and too wet to be just mist.
"Dreichle" weather came to describe those days when one might leave the house questioning the need for either a coat or sunglasses, embodying the spirit's playful indecision. It became a term of endearment and slight exasperation among the locals, capturing the whimsy of their climate in a word that sounded as if it had been passed down through generations, even if its origins were as nebulous as the weather it described.

    <h1>Influence Me</h1>
    <p><em>This is a an experiment, not something I've tried before.</em></p>
    <p>I'm Danny Ayers, aka Daniel John Ayers, @danja on some social media, email : danny.ayers@gmail.com</p>
    <p>
        I work on projects that I personally believe are <em>good for humanity and the planet</em>, however indirectly.
        But my real motivation is purely selfish, I find this stuff interesting. Coding etc. is what I play at instead
        of
        games.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't have a regular income. [TODO update CV]. So any tips, no matter how small will be greatly
        appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>Also I'm easily influenced, if you have suggestions for something I should work on or lean my ongoing efforts
        towards,
        let me know. Although this is entirely voluntary and I make absolutely no guarantees, a little financial
        assistance is likely to increase that influence. </p>
    <p>
        I've set up a couple of payment channels :
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=6DK2AG5GF5YS4">PayPal</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://patreon.com/danja">Patreon</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Thanks!</em></strong>

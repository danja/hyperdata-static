# About

*This site needed an `About` page, and when I got around to thinking about it, I was reminded about someone who's been a good friend of many years, who I've not been in contact with for a very long time. I do think of `hyperdata.it` as an entity in it's own right, an umbrella for stuff, perhaps an organisation if you include people I collaborate with, if necessary a business if needed to simplify tax... But today it's all my own stuff, so the `About` can mostly be egocentrically about me, no apologies.*  

So a very brief description of this site, a bit of background about me for folks I haven't met before, a fairly long description of how I am/what I'm up to - like the **round-robin** letters Americans distribute at Xmas, telling of Hayleigh's new school, that no-one reads.

### Recent Prehistory

The question I get asked most when meeting new people is : 

#### How did you end up in Italy?

To get that out of the way, first, where we were beforehand :

My wife Caroline & I were living in a little (heavily-mortgaged) house in Buxton. For a good many years she's been working at a place for special needs folks, I'd been'working at at High Peak College : looking after the network, IT support, tiny bit of teaching (lousy pay for what I was doing, but I enjoyed being there, good people & challenges).  It was far from uncomfortable, but neither of us had fun prospects from where we were. Career-wise, Carolines next step would have been management (soon), but what she enjoyed was the interaction with the clients. For me, the College started a merger (landgrab) with Derby University. This would probably have meant a much better salary for me, but... My boss at HPC was wonderful, gave me a huge amount of independence (any time aside from doing *what had to be done* I spent on learning stuff that might have been useful there). Of course she had the final word, and had to answer to senior management (with whom she often disagreed). But treated the team as equals, and there was a lot of trust all around. Post-merger, ok, I'd probably ended up with a much better salary, but in a rigid role fairly low in the hierachy (I'm relatively unqualified). Also the guy who would have been my new boss was a **total arsehole**. Arrogant, bullying, sexist... you name it. I found it problematic to be in the same room as him, really didn't want to work under him.   

We travelled whenever possible. Everytime we'd be in another country, we agreed : *this is so much nicer than the UK* (we'd usually be off the tourist track, so this includes places like rough bits of Turkey and povert-stricken bits of Morocco, even Wales). 

Important back story - Caroline had previously done a course on teaching English as a foreign language, I'd recently started getting extra income from writing/tech-reviewing books on programming, approaching that of the day job.  

One day we decided we'd had enough. Buggered off to the last place we'd been on holiday, Sri Lanka.

Away from this computer I spend a lot at another doing music stuff. Mostly electronic, but also bad guitar, worse guitar, abysmal voice (I also design synths)

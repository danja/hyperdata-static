#### Step One : GitPod

I don't remember using it before, but I may well have done. First thing that happened when I followed the link (using GitHub credentials) it said I was upgraded to an organisation. Appears free 50 hours, then pay-as-you-go.

I got to an in-browser (I've running Brave on Ubuntu) VS Code.  

At the terminal it appears to have run :

```npm ci && npm run build
...
  vite build --outDir=../../dist examples/browser
```
Dependencies installed ok, dist built ok.
Somewhere I briefly saw the option to launch it in a local VS Code. Try that later...

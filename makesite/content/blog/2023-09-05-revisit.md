Wowza! I asked ChatGPT with Diagrams Plugin to generate a UML sequence diagram for a SPARQL query to DBPedia: A+ grade

LLMs are far, far, far! from AGI but very useful. ChatGPT and CoPilot are fixtures of my Emacs setup, and web versions including Bard, Midjourney, and Bing+GPT are solidly in my workflow.

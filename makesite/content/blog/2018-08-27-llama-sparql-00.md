<!-- title: llama_index-SPARQL notes 01 -->

> This is a continuation of notes from [GraphRAG](https://github.com/danja/nlp/tree/main/GraphRAG). I'm currently writing a SPARQL connector for llama_index, and jotting notes as I go along. My Wordpress install recently broke, but because a SPARQL-backed blog engine was on my TODO list I let it ride. But it occurred to me that an easy stopgap would be to use a minimal static blog/site builder as an interim fix (makesite.py fit the bill), use it for the GraphRAG notes too. **Nice layout with bells & whistles to follow!**

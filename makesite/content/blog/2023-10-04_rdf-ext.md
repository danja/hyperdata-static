<!-- title: RDF-Ext : Starting -->

I reached a first little milestone with SPARQL GraphRAG, `sparql.py` for LlamaIndex in being able to get [a demo running on a Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cRAflpG2v1rS9Nz6xpILpPouuvILpYlL).

But I need to switch focus for a bit.

I'm about to start kicking the tyres/writing up [RDF-Ext](https://rdf-ext.org/). It's a dev-friendly toolkit for using RDF in browser/node JS, bridging to the fairly opaque/formal RDFJS specs.

The [Tutorial](https://rdf-ext.org/tutorial/) seems as good a place as any to start.

#### Step One : GitPod

I don't remember using it before, but I may well have done. First thing that happened when I followed the link (using GitHub credentials) it said I was upgraded to an organisation. Appears free 50 hours, then pay-as-you-go.

I got to an in-browser (I've running Brave on Ubuntu) VS Code.  

At the terminal it appears to have run :

```npm ci && npm run build
...
  vite build --outDir=../../dist examples/browser
```
Dependencies installed ok, dist built ok.
Somewhere I briefly saw the option to launch it in a local VS Code. Try that later...

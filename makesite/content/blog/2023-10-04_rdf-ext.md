<!-- title: RDF-Ext : Starting -->

I reached a first little milestone with SPARQL GraphRAG, `sparql.py` for LlamaIndex in being able to get [a demo running on a Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cRAflpG2v1rS9Nz6xpILpPouuvILpYlL).

But I need to switch focus for a bit.

I'm about to start kicking the tyres/writing up [RDF-Ext](https://rdf-ext.org/). It's a dev-friendly toolkit for using RDF in browser/node JS, bridging to the fairly opaque/formal RDFJS specs.

The [Tutorial](https://rdf-ext.org/tutorial/) seems as good a place as any to start.

<!-- title: llama_index SPARQL Notes 07 -->

Ok, time to attack the bits listed at the end of yesterday's [post](https://hyperdata.it/blog/llama-sparql-06/).

Break time. Made some progress, but got a bit distracted starting a [master plan](https://github.com/danja/nlp/blob/main/GraphRAG/goal.md). Pretty much than same as I'd already put in the [GraphRAG doc](https://github.com/danja/nlp/tree/main/GraphRAG), but expanded a bit, more background, hopefully a better explanation for folks that occupy other Venn diagrams.

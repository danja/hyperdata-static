recommends [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

I opted for the full version -

- pipx install --include-deps ansible

_ew_, initial bits painful, found the docs confusing, maybe assume more prior knowledge than I have (only used Docker a bit, have never used Ansible). More worrying, I haven't a clue what it's stuck on my server.

**2023-08-30**

The Ansible thing did look like it'd mostly run ok, but things definitely fell apart around `nginx`. Very likely cause being host:port clash, as I already have an Apache server in front on hyperdata.it/127.0.0.1 :80 and :443

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/changing-nginx-port-in-linux/

I changed the default config yesterday, but just looked again, there's actually :

```
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default
/etc/nginx/sites-available/hyperdata.it.conf
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperdata.it.conf
```

So I've deleted the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` symlink and changed `hyperdata.it.conf` to use **port 8421**

- sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
- _failed_
- systemctl status nginx.service | less
- nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:443 failed

I'm pretty sure I don't need https/443 on nginx, I've got Apache doing that, is proxying to Fuseki etc on plain http on different ports. So I've deleted that section from `hyperdata.it.conf`

- systemctl restart nginx.service
- systemctl status nginx.service

Yay!

Hmm. http://hyperdata.it:8421 just redirects to https://hyperdata.it/

On server,

- apt install lynx
- lynx http://127.0.0.1:8421

Aha! That's my placeholder for `https://danny.ayers.name/`, configured in Apache.

Where are my notes on Apache setup..?

`~/HKMS/server-setup/` apparently - TODO make that easier to find

**distraction** danbri mentioned XMPP (for ChatGPT) yesterday, it appears I have ejabberd installed. Is it running? see [ejabberd Notes](ejabberd)

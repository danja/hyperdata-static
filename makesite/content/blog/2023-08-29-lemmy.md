recommends [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

I opted for the full version -

- pipx install --include-deps ansible

_ew_, initial bits painful, found the docs confusing, maybe assume more prior knowledge than I have (only used Docker a bit, have never used Ansible). More worrying, I haven't a clue what it's stuck on my server.

**2023-08-30**

The Ansible thing did look like it'd mostly run ok, but things definitely fell apart around `nginx`. Very likely cause being host:port clash, as I already have an Apache server in front on hyperdata.it/127.0.0.1 :80 and :443

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/changing-nginx-port-in-linux/

I changed the default config yesterday, but just looked again, there's actually :

```
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default
/etc/nginx/sites-available/hyperdata.it.conf
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/hyperdata.it.conf
```

So I've deleted the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` symlink and changed `hyperdata.it.conf` to use **port 8421**

- sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
- _failed_
- systemctl status nginx.service | less
- nginx: [emerg] bind() to 0.0.0.0:443 failed

I'm pretty sure I don't need https/443 on nginx, I've got Apache doing that, is proxying to Fuseki etc on plain http on different ports. So I've deleted that section from `hyperdata.it.conf`

- systemctl restart nginx.service
- systemctl status nginx.service

> Active: active (running) since Wed 2023-08-30 09:27:02 UTC; 12s ago

Yay!

Hmm. http://hyperdata.it:8421 just redirects to https://hyperdata.it/

On server,

- apt install lynx
- lynx http://127.0.0.1:8421

> Currently reorganising the server. I'll put my FOAF/Solid here soon, for now my contact details should be at :

Aha! That's my placeholder for `https://danny.ayers.name/`, configured in Apache.

Where are my notes on Apache setup..?

`~/HKMS/server-setup/` apparently - TODO make that easier to find

**distraction** danbri mentioned XMPP (for ChatGPT) yesterday, it appears I have ejabberd installed. Is it running? see [ejabberd Notes](ejabberd)

```

The only 301 that looked relevant was in :

nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/hyperdata.it.conf

so I removed that block

systemctl restart nginx.service

https://lemmy.hyperdata.it/ seems to redirect to http://lemmy.hyperdata.it/, nginx starter page.

That redirect was needed!

put it back, random longshot, removed (shouldn't be needed after Apache..?):

```
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }
```

in /var/log/nginx/access.log

```
127.0.0.1 - - [01/Sep/2023:11:31:41 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 162 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/116.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

It looks like it's getting that far, but the lemmy bit isn't doing anything

https://join-lemmy.org/docs/administration/troubleshooting.html

root@localhost:/home/hmks-apps/lemmy/hyperdata.it# docker-compose logs -f lemmy

```
...

```

I was in the middle of typing a message to ask for help on r/lemmy, when something occurred to me. Maybe Ansible doesn't do the external services. It's plausible that I'd already installed nginx, Ansible just added a config. But postgres, pictrs (?), the smpt service..?

sudo apt install postgresql

> The postgresql service is an "umbrella" service whose purpose is to start or stop the services named postgresql@version-instance which are the actual services that you are interested in. To get the statuses of these, run sudo systemctl status 'postgresql\*'

a PostgreSQL Cluster is running...

https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/PostgreSQL_GetStarted.html

initial client access :

- sudo -u postgres psql
- \l (list DBs)

there is a DB postgres, owner postgres

wait, https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1847

- root@localhost:/home/hmks-apps/lemmy/hyperdata.it# docker ps

postgres was already running under docker :

- docker-compose exec postgres psql -U lemmy

making sure it's using the same password as in lemmy.hjson

- lemmy=# \password

ew, nginx & posgres

docker stop e519719e228e (nginx)
docker restart 3394683cf319
docker restart 3792edf55801
docker restart 157491f6495f
docker restart 9da7a413d90b
docker restart 58f4af628105

no change

systemctl stop nginx
docker start e519719e228e

slight change

https://lemmy.hyperdata.it/
->
http://lemmy.hyperdata.it/

503 Service Unavailable

that's a change. Next need to check the logs. But enough for today.

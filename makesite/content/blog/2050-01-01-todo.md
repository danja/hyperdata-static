<!-- title: Blog TODO -->

_far in the future_

I rather like this mode of blogging, type markdown into VSCode, `makesite.py` converts/formats it, use git (in a script) to transfer to server.

First, add a bit to p (publish) to ssh into server, then :

```
cd /home/hkms-apps/hyperdata-static
git pull
```

Soonish :

- layout : make it prettier & more navigable, maybe make it 2 or 3 column for index etc.
- add a forward-chrono view from a given post, makes more sense with the things like continuing notes (can always make it more sophisticated via SPARQL store)
- add support for multiple topic-specific blogs
- add a directory treewalker to send the content etc. up to my SPARQL store (I've a feeling I've done this before in Python, very straightforward - it's be quicker to do afresh, with the help of `sparqlwrapper` and ChatGPT)

I reckon I'll split `makesite.py` up, modularise a bit. Even if I move to all SPARQL-backed for the blog, it's bound to be useful somewhere.

Things for later :

#### Turtle plugin for markdown

similar to https://github.com/ozekik/markdown-ld

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozekik/markdown-ld/master/examples/foaf.md

Requirements :

1. independent of, but compatible with existing markdown tools
2. extensible, reasonably modular
3. block identifier & delimiters
4. useful defaults, easily overriden

For most of 1 & 2, make it easy to put in pipeline, something like :

markdown, other = mx(markdown_with_extensions)

for 3, maybe :

mx:turtle
'''

```
<this> a x:That.
```

For 4, for starters I'd probably be good to had some standard prefixes as default, added by the processor, which could be overriden :

mx:turtle
mx:prefixes
'''

```
prefix ...

<this> a x:That.
```

'''

```Reminder to self, tuples in Python
>>> pair = (1, 2)
>>> pair
(1, 2)
>>> x, y = pair
>>> x
1
>>> y
2

>>> pair[0]
1
>>> pair[
```

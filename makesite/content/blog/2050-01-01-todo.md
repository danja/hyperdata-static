<!-- title: Blog TODO -->

_far in the future_

I rather like this mode of blogging, type markdown into VSCode, `makesite.py` converts/formats it, use git (in a script) to transfer to server.

Three things to do soonish :

- layout : make it prettier & more navigable, maybe make it 2 or 3 column for index etc.
- add a forward-chrono view from a given post, makes more sense with the things like continuing notes (can always make it more sophisticated via SPARQL store)
- add a directory treewalker to send the content etc. up to my SPARQL store (I've a feeling I've done this before in Python, very straightforward - it's be quicker to do afresh, with the help of `sparqlwrapper` and ChatGPT)

I reckon I'll split `makesite.py` up, modularise a bit. Even if I move to all SPARQL-backed for the blog, it's bound to be useful somewhere.

<!-- title: llama_index SPARQL Notes 20 -->

I've been fixing some of the things GitHub complained about when I did a pull request. Luckily things that ChatGPT can help with.

I've added type annotations to `sparql.py`, started writing some tests.

added sparqlwrapper to setup.py

* export PYTHONPATH=/home/danny/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index

* danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index$ pip install -e .

* danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index$ pytest tests/graph_stores/test_simple.py

* danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index$ pytest tests/graph_stores/test_simple.py > ../testy.md

ok, ChatGPT got the shape of the returned values wrong (so much for type annotations!) but was easy to fix.

Next is the more challenging one, `test_sparql.py`.

Give ChatGPT a zip. Include `paths.txt` so it gets the imports right.

"I wish to create a pytest test. I will now upload a zip of files. Look at the functions in test_simple.py and their relation to functions in simple.py, remember these. I will then give you further instructions"

"I would like a test file, `test_sparql.py` that will test all the functions in `sparql.py`. Much of this will be very similar to `test_simple.py` as they both follow the same interface, `types.py`. I would like you to go through every function in `sparql.py` one at a time and create at test for it. Don't show me any results until this is done. Combine them into `test_sparqly.py` and give me that. Keep explanation to a minimum. Do not ask me for confirmation, just continue until you have a full response."

much time, many prompts later...

* pytest tests/graph_stores/test_sparql.py > ../testy.md

9 errors. I noticed "EndPointNotFound"

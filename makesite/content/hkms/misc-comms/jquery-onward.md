Anyone happen to know what things like jQuery are now in browser specs/due in the near future? I'm out of touch.
I've got a bunch of 10-year legacy JS code using jQuery to tidy up/extend, I want functionality comparable to the frameworks, but lightweight and as vanilla as possible. What can I already replace? How best should I angle it ready for future specs? (Polyfills?) Any bits of #CSS relevant?

Outdated on browser specs & jQuery. Need to update 10-yr-old JS code. Want lightweight, future-ready features. What can I replace? Use polyfills? Any CSS tips?

I'm out of touch with browser capabilities. Updating 10-yr-old JS code that's jQuery-heavy. Want lightweight *vanilla*, future-spec ready features. What of jQuery can I already replace? Any polyfills? Relevant CSS?

Vanilla replacements for jQuery?
Hiya WebDev folks!
I've got a bunch of legacy JS code which uses jQuery a lot, some of which is about 10 years old, but still basically useful and worth updating. Bit I'm out of touch with recent developments around browser/spec capabilities. I want to tidy up the code and extend here & there. I really don't want to get tied to a framework, keep it as vanilla as possible. So I'd like to know which parts of jQuery already have vanilla equivalents, supported by most browsers? What's on the way? Are there any polyfills that aren't laden with dependencies? Also CSS, any new stuff in particular I should be aware of there?

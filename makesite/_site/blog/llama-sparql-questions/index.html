<p class="meta">Published on 2023-09-07 by <b>@danja</b></p>
<p>Immediate goal is to recreate Wey's Graph RAG demo but using a SPARQL store rather than NebulaGraph.</p>
<p>I'm running it as <a href="https://github.com/danja/nlp/blob/main/GraphRAG/src/graph-rag-sparql-minimal.py">graph-rag-sparql-minimal.py</a>. The in-progress <a href="https://github.com/danja/llama_index/blob/add-sparql/llama_index/graph_stores/sparql.py">sparql.py</a> (<code>rels()</code> will be called from <code>get_rel_map()</code>).</p>
<p>I've got data going to the store <em>something like it should</em> using <code>graph_store.upsert()</code>. Data coming back from calls to <code>graph_store.get_rel_map()</code> that appears to be <em>more or less</em> the right shape. But an issue with each I would appreciate advice on.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Batching data</p>
<p>Right now I've set up INSERT queries to add triplets (as RDF triples) one at a time to the store. It's <em>really</em> inefficient because each has to be wrapped in a query skeleton and POSTed over HTTP. I imagine some kind of batch handling is already implemented somewhere, but I couldn't find anything I understood. It isn't essential right now, but if there is something, pointers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loops in graph data</p>
<p>This is a breaking issue for me right now. I'm sure I can sort it out, but a little more knowledge should make that quicker :)
So at some point the data is fed through <code>llama_index/llama_index/response_synthesizers/tree_summarize.py</code>.
I get <code>RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison</code>, so seems likely there's a loop somewhere. Short term, some kind of check+delete should fix that (algorithm hunt time). But more generally, what is the situation with graphs &amp; loops? Is this an underlying problem in the way Graph RAG operates, or is it just an implementation issue?</p>

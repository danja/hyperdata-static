<p><em>Got some funds so I paid some API credit. But have spent the day so far on admin and bits &amp; pieces that were niggling me. And now, 16:47, it's dogwalk time. But I need a bit of fresh air, clear head for <code>sparql.py</code>.</em>
<strong>Back from dogwalk</strong></p>
<p>Credit balance $29.87</p>
<pre><code>sudo /usr/local/nebula/scripts/nebula.service start all
cd ~/AI/nlp/GraphRAG/src
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/danny/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index
python graph-rag-nebulagraph-minimal.py
</code></pre>
<p>5 or 6 runs with little tweaks in between. OpenAI credit still says $29.87.</p>
<p>No idea why, this returned a <MarkdownObject> rather than text. So pulled that out.</p>
<p>It also ends on an exception from calling -</p>
<pre><code>    def __del__(self) -&gt; None:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Close NebulaGraph session pool.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        self._session_pool.close()
</code></pre>
<p><em>But</em>, before that it says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Quill is the half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The log isn't any more useful -</p>

<p>Hmm, log level..?</p>
<p>Tweaked a bit, noticed it's loading index from <code>./storage_graph/docstore.json</code></p>
<p>Oops, I pulled out the code for generating the kg when I was looking at the upload bits without OpenAI</p>
<p>TypeError: can only concatenate str (not &quot;list&quot;) to str</p>
<p>ok,</p>
<pre><code>for s in subjs:
    logger.warning('s =' + str(s))
</code></pre>
<p>a couple more tweaks later it ran through. <em>Much</em> more interesting logs!</p>
<p>First thing of note :</p>

<p>right, this looks where the triplets for a subj are got &amp; returned</p>
<p><em>raw snipped</em></p>
<p>I saved that chunks as rel_map.json and let VSCode try to format it - much clearer. Kinda...</p>
<p>PS. format a bit by hand</p>
<pre><code>{'Peter Quill': [
    'Peter Quill, -[would return to the MCU]-&gt;, May 2021, &lt;-[would return to the MCU]-, Peter Quill',
    'Peter Quill, -[would return to the MCU]-&gt;, May 2021',
    'Peter Quill, -[was raised by]-&gt;, a group of alien thieves and smugglers',
    'Peter Quill, -[is leader of]-&gt;, Guardians of the Galaxy',
    'Peter Quill, -[would return to the MCU]-&gt;, May 2021, &lt;-[Gunn reaffirmed]-, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3',
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, a format in a format. I don't know why there are backwards arrows and apparently repetition, but the basic stuff will be straightforward from SPARQL results. I reckon I'll start with simple forward-arrow triples, see if that communicates enough.</p>
<p>oh wait, line 1124 :</p>

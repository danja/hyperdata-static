    <em>Interim blog setup, rough notes being dumped here at the moment - I'll tidy once I get to a milestone. And sorry
        about the layout, that'll probably take even longer to get around to... #TODO</em>

<p class="meta">Published on 1970-01-01 by <b>@danja</b></p>
<p>I reached a first little milestone with SPARQL GraphRAG, <code>sparql.py</code> for LlamaIndex in being able to get <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cRAflpG2v1rS9Nz6xpILpPouuvILpYlL">a demo running on a Colab notebook</a>.</p>
<p>But I need to switch focus for a bit.</p>
<p>I'm about to start kicking the tyres/writing up <a href="https://rdf-ext.org/">RDF-Ext</a>. It's a dev-friendly toolkit for using RDF in browser/node JS, bridging to the fairly opaque/formal RDFJS specs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rdf-ext.org/tutorial/">Tutorial</a> seems as good a place as any to start.</p>

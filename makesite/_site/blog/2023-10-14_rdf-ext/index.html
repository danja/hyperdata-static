    <em>Interim blog setup, rough notes being dumped here at the moment - I'll tidy once I get to a milestone. And sorry
        about the layout, that'll probably take even longer to get around to... #TODO</em>

<h4>Step One : GitPod</h4>
<p>I don't remember using it before, but I may well have done. First thing that happened when I followed the link (using GitHub credentials) it said I was upgraded to an organisation. Appears free 50 hours, then pay-as-you-go.</p>
<p>I got to an in-browser (I've running Brave on Ubuntu) VS Code.</p>
<p>At the terminal it appears to have run :</p>
<pre><code class="language-npm">...
  vite build --outDir=../../dist examples/browser
</code></pre>
<p>Dependencies installed ok, dist built ok.
Somewhere I briefly saw the option to launch it in a local VS Code. Try that later...</p>

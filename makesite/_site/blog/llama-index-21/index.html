<p>I've been fixing some of the things GitHub complained about when I did a pull request. Luckily things that ChatGPT can help with.</p>
<p>I've added type annotations to <code>sparql.py</code>, started writing some tests.</p>
<p>added sparqlwrapper to setup.py</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>export PYTHONPATH=/home/danny/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index$ pip install -e .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index$ pytest tests/graph_stores/test_simple.py</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LIBS-under-dev/llama_index$ pytest tests/graph_stores/test_simple.py &gt; ../testy.md</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ok, ChatGPT got the shape of the returned values wrong (so much for type annotations!) but was easy to fix.</p>
<p>Next is the more challenging one, <code>test_sparql.py</code>.</p>
<p>Give ChatGPT a zip. Include <code>paths.txt</code> so it gets the imports right.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to create a pytest test. I will now upload a zip of files. Look at the functions in test_simple.py and their relation to functions in simple.py, remember these. I will then give you further instructions&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would like a test file, <code>test_sparql.py</code> that will test all the functions in <code>sparql.py</code>. Much of this will be very similar to <code>test_simple.py</code> as they both follow the same interface, <code>types.py</code>. I would like you to go through every function in <code>sparql.py</code> one at a time and create at test for it. Don't show me any results until this is done. Combine them into <code>test_sparqly.py</code> and give me that. Keep explanation to a minimum. Do not ask me for confirmation, just continue until you have a full response.&quot;</p>
<p>much time, many prompts later...</p>
<ul>
<li>pytest tests/graph_stores/test_sparql.py &gt; ../testy.md</li>
</ul>
<p>9 errors. I noticed &quot;EndPointNotFound&quot;</p>

<h1><a href="/blog/llama-sparql-04/">llama_index SPARQL Notes 04</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2023-08-30 by <b>@danja</b></p>
<p>Continuing from <a href="2023-08-29-llama-sparql-03">yesterday</a> on getting data from a NebulaGraph store and putting it into a SPARQL store.</p>
<p>I was able to get a condensed JSON rendition of the Entity data from NebulaGraph, now to do the same with Relationships</p>
<pre><code>USE guardians;
MATCH (src:entity)-[e:relationship]-&gt;(dst:entity)
RETURN src, e, dst
LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>
<p>ChatGPT time -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The task will be to create a function to extend an existing Python file. The purpose of this is to take data of a specific shape from a NebulaGraph DB via the nebula3 API and save it in a condensed form as JSON text. I will first give you the nGQL statements that were used to create the NebulaGraph space, then upload a the file, then describe the function I would like to add to it. Here are the nGQL statements :</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>CREATE SPACE guardians(vid_type=FIXED_STRING(256), partition_num=1, replica_factor=1);
:sleep 10;
USE guardians;
CREATE TAG entity(name string);
CREATE EDGE relationship(relationship string);
:sleep 10;
CREATE TAG INDEX entity_index ON entity(name(256));
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In the file there is the API call :
resp = client.execute_json('MATCH (v:entity) RETURN v')
I will add :
resp_rel = client.execute_json('MATCH (src:entity)-[e:relationship]-&gt;(dst:entity) RETURN src, e, dst')
json_rel_str = resp_rel.decode('utf-8')
Please write a function extract_relationships(json_rel_str) following the pattern of extract_entities(json_data)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What it gave me looks close, but the output was :</p>
<pre><code>    {'src': 'N/A', 'relationship': 'N/A', 'dst': 'N/A'
    },
    {'src': 'N/A', 'relationship': 'N/A', 'dst': 'N/A'
    },
...
</code></pre>
<p>I will upload a file containing a single result from the database. I would like the data extracted from this by the function extract_relationships to be:
[{&quot;src&quot;: &quot;production on Vol.3&quot;, &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;relationship&quot;, &quot;dst&quot;: &quot;February 2021&quot;}]
please modify the function accordingly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT

It appears that I forgot to request the file upload. Could you please upload the file containing a single result from the database? This will help me modify the extract_relationships function to meet your requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We went around in circles a lot. ChatGPT's mapping was repeatedly out, I hadn't looked closely neough at the NebulaGraph results.</p>
<p>But finally I ran with :</p>
<pre><code>resp_rel = client.execute_json(
    'MATCH (src:entity)-[e:relationship]-&gt;(dst:entity) RETURN src, e, dst' LIMIT 1)
</code></pre>
<p>effectively <em>make it like</em> :</p>
<pre><code>[{&quot;s&quot;: &quot;production on Vol.3&quot;, &quot;p&quot;: &quot;was put on hold until&quot;, &quot;o&quot;: &quot;February 2021&quot;}]
</code></pre>
<p>Yes! There are a lot of duplicates in the output but I'll just hack that for now. But I think I've done the unfmiliar bits now, the RDF/SPARQL side should be straightforward from here.</p>
<p>Enough for today.</p>
<p><strong>This would probably have been much easier with JSON-LD. But since I started down this path...</strong></p>

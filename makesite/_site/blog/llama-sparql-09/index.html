    <em>Interim blog setup, rough notes being dumped here at the moment - I'll tidy once I get to a milestone. And sorry
        about the layout, that'll probably take even longer to get around to... #TODO</em>

<p><em>I lost internet connectivity last night, woke up this morning with no electricity. The electric came on pretty soon - I had been warned ENEL were messing with the village wiring. The net took a trip into town to sort out (billing error, and then they took ages to switch me back on). The money I was expecting hasn't yet arrived t the bank, so still no OpenAI credit. So I spent most of the day staring at the wall/Twitter.</em></p>
<p>Ok, it seems like I was looking at the wrong place to put the query. Not <code>query()</code> but :</p>
<pre><code>    def get(self, subj: str) -&gt; List[List[str]]:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Get triplets.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>The implementation in <code>nebulagraph.py</code> is <em>scary</em>!</p>
<p>Fool Danny, I forgot to put a logger bit in to check what gets returned there.</p>
<p>In <code>simple.py</code> :</p>
<pre><code>    def get(self, subj: str) -&gt; List[List[str]]:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Get triplets.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return self._data.graph_dict.get(subj, [])
</code></pre>
<p>Wey mentions 'flattened' around <code>get_rel_map()</code>, where the subject is given with a list of associated rel, obj. But this looks less flat.</p>
<p>I'll assume for now, if data =</p>
<pre><code>&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;
&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;four&quot;
&quot;two&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;four&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><code>get('one')</code> will return :</p>
<pre><code>[[`one', 'two', 'three'], ['one','two','four']]
</code></pre>
<p>Now I'm confused. I did put a logger into <code>get()</code>, list of lists, <strong>lol</strong>. Nothing came out.</p>
<p>Ok, I'll make a helper method that acts as above, see where it go when I can see the behaviour again.</p>
<p>@prefix er: <a href="http://purl.org/stuff/er#">http://purl.org/stuff/er#</a> .
@base <a href="http://purl.org/stuff/data">http://purl.org/stuff/data</a> .</p>
<p>Query like :</p>
<pre><code>PREFIX er:  &lt;http://purl.org/stuff/er#&gt;
BASE &lt;http://purl.org/stuff/data&gt;

SELECT DISTINCT ?rel ?obj WHERE {
    GRAPH &lt;http://purl.org/stuff/guardians&gt; {
        ?triplet a er:Triplet ;
            er:subject ?subject ;
            er:property ?property ;
            er:object ?object .

        ?subject er:value ?subj_string .
        ?property er:value ?rel .
        ?object er:value ?obj .
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, that worked via Fuseki's UI. For code, replace <code>?subj_string</code> with <code>{subj}</code>. Put it in <code>def sparql_query(self, query_string):</code></p>
<p>sparqlwrapper will not doubt need help producing what I want, need to RTFM there, <code>results.response</code> somewhere - if it's available as a list of lists that'd be nice.</p>
<p>I'm using GET method, I don't like POST unless really necessary (it's floppy in the spec).</p>
<p>I must <strong>make an endpoint-focused test for this</strong></p>
<p>Wired in to <code>get()</code>, that'll do for today.</p>

    <em>Interim blog setup, rough notes being dumped here at the moment - I'll tidy once I get to a milestone. And sorry
        about the layout, that'll probably take even longer to get around to... #TODO</em>

<p><em>far in the future</em></p>
<p>I rather like this mode of blogging, type markdown into VSCode, <code>makesite.py</code> converts/formats it, use git (in a script) to transfer to server.</p>
<p>Three things to do soonish :</p>
<ul>
<li>layout : make it prettier &amp; more navigable, maybe make it 2 or 3 column for index etc.</li>
<li>add a forward-chrono view from a given post, makes more sense with the things like continuing notes (can always make it more sophisticated via SPARQL store)</li>
<li>add a directory treewalker to send the content etc. up to my SPARQL store (I've a feeling I've done this before in Python, very straightforward - it's be quicker to do afresh, with the help of <code>sparqlwrapper</code> and ChatGPT)</li>
</ul>
<p>I reckon I'll split <code>makesite.py</code> up, modularise a bit. Even if I move to all SPARQL-backed for the blog, it's bound to be useful somewhere.</p>

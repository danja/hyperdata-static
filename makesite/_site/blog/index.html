        <h3>Today</h3>
<p><em>I'm down to $0.23 OpenAI API credit, so until I next have $ need to look at things that don't need it. <code>sparql.py</code> doesn't in itself need the OpenAI API, but a SPARQLy version of Wey Gu's Notebook is my target functional E2E test.</em></p>
<p>I still have NebulaGraph data generated from Wey's Notebook. I can use nebula-client to pull out data from there, RDFLib to build RDF, sparqlwrapper to push to store. The SPARQL needed will be essentially the same as for <code>sparql.py</code>. Also NebulaGraph &lt;=&gt; RDF utils would be nice to have (may already exist, but I'll pretend I didn't consider that).</p>
<p>Then -</p>
<ul>
<li>have a look around <em>3 Create VectorStoreIndex for RAG</em> in Notebook</li>

<p>My attention's been skipping around, spent a lot of time trying to engage with ChatGPT. There are bits of prompts I tried in <a href="/blog/llama-sparql-01">llama_index SPARQL Notes 01</a>.</p>
<p>Time to get back to the code proper (continuing from <a href="/blog/llama-sparql-00">llama_index SPARQL Notes 00</a>).</p>
<p>I've roughed out the shape of RDF I <em>think</em> I need :</p>

<p>Today's task : as yesterday.</p>
<p>It's occurred to me that it would be helpful to look at the data that nebulagraph.py actually looks at - pop a few logging calls in there.</p>
<p>(Maybe also probe - https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python )</p>

<p>Ok, found it at :</p>

<p>Hmm, which of Wey Gu's demos is the most minimal that uses NebulaGraph?</p>
<p>Custom instructions</p>
<pre><code>Act as a expert in Python and graph data structures, in particular the RDF model and SPARQL. Be prepared for questions relating to Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation and the llama_index libraries. Follow best practices everywhere, eg. including short comments as necessary in code. Outside of code, keep all responses and descriptions very concise and matter-of-fact. Whenever you think it's possible I have further information or code files to upload that will help in the tasks, please ask.

<p>~~Act as a expert in Python and graph data structures as implemented in NebulaGraph and RDF and SPARQL. ~~</p>
<pre><code>Existing code in llama_index includes communications to a NebulaGraph database via the nebula-python library. The goal for us today is to develop code in a file sparql.py having the same functionality as nebulagraph.py, but instead of NebulaGraph will connect to a SPARQL store via the sparqlwrapper library from RDFLib. There are several subtasks to do first, which I will describe after uploading some relevant code.

Here a zip of llama_index/llama_index/graph_stores

<blockquote>
<p>Before writing Python, we will look at the data model. The following are the nGQL statements used to prepare the database for for nebulagraph.py. How would this an equilent schema be expressed in RDF, and what would an example of instance data look like?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Nebula Graph, you're defining a space guardians with vertex IDs as fixed-length strings. You also define a tag entity with a property name of type string, and an edge type relationship with a property relationship of type string.

    <h2><a href="/blog/Graph-of-Thoughs-initial-thoughts/">Graph of Thoughts, initial thoughts</a></h2>
    <p class="meta">Published on 2023-08-27 by <b>@danja</b></p>

    <p class="content">
        <p><em>Work in progress, scrappy notes &amp; thoughts to pull together. What sprang to mind, not thought through, likely much rubbish.</em></p>
<p>So I finally got around to reading the recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09687">Graph of Thoughts : Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models</a> paper. <em>&quot;Finally&quot; in the sense of it only appeared at Arxiv just over a week or so ago, I printed a couple of days ago. Things are moving sooo fast...</em></p>
<p>I do need to re-read it a few more times, also check some of the refs, there are bound to be papers that address the bits mentioned below (several are graph-related).So, initial thoughts. First is <strong>meta</strong>, the most important, subsuming everything else: <strong>It's really well written!</strong>. Research only really becomes useful when it's communicated. The text is as plain English as you can get with such material. Loads of acronyms, but that's unavoidable. But where they are significant, they're expanded and explained. Only as much maths as necessary, lovely - so often in this field, complicated sums muddy the water. Lots of clear-enough diagrams. Content-wise : <strong>Strong Accept</strong>.</p>
<p>Regarding content, in no particular order :</p>
<p>There are really tasty chunks, I really like the general approach.</p>
<p>For starters, identification of concrete goals : <code>How best to aggregate thoughts to maximise accuracy and minimise cost?</code>.
Some of the terms used (I've no idea which originated here or elsewhere, is irrelevant), like <code>Graph of Operations, GoO</code> and <code>Graph Reasoning State, GRS </code> are great markers for particular concepts.
The metric <strong>Volume</strong> the authors provide looks like it could be <strong>incredibly useful</strong>. It's stated in a couple of places, the plain English version is :</p>
<p><code>We define volume - for a given thought t - as the number of preceding LLM thoughts that could have impacted t</code></p>
<p>The evaluation seems broad enough to be reliable, applied in a way that makes sense. The use cases are seriously uninspiring, but I'd say that adds weight to this thing having potential - I think it would do better on harder problem.</p>
<p>Frankly <strong>I am very surprised</strong> they got results as good as they did. Ok, I personally think approaches along these lines can offer huge benefits over current Tree-of-Thought etc techniques. But I've had given it another year or so of architecture trial and error before seeing any noticeable gain. One of the use cases is keyword counting - from what I've seen, ChatGPT's ability with arithmetic is below that of a 5-year old, only marginally above that of a certain former US president.</p>
<p>Description Logics as a generalization</p>
<p>is all quasi-procedural logic
I
things like applying tabl</p>

<p>to ping

<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20030418021226/http://ideagraph.net/xmlns/ibis/</p>
<p>https://vocab.methodandstructure.com/ibis</p>
<p>I hadn't thought through how to do it (see this paper!), but the <em>Graph of Thoughts</em> notion was a very visible next step after <em>Chain...</em> and <em>Tree...</em>. I discussed it with ChatGPT <a href="https://twitter.com/danja/status/1671680152500322304">a little while ago</a>. This reinforced my feeling that it should be a productive avenue, so at the end of our conversation I asked ChatGPT for advertizing copy to promote it :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unleash the power of graph-of-thought in LLM dialogues! Represent ideas as nodes, relationships as edges, and explore a web of knowledge. Navigate non-linearly, uncover intricate connections, and foster context-aware discussions.&quot;</p>

<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Implementing a naive SPARQL connector, just enough to replicate the functional of Wey Gu's original demo with a SPARQL store rather than NebulaGraph.</p>
<p><em>I've read the books, but still my inclination on something like this would usually be to go straight to the implementation, only making tests when it (predictably) doesn't work. But my Python is weak and this codebase is new to me, so test-driven it is.</em></p>
<p>There don't appear to be any tests around the graph stores yet, so start against existing implementations, so, to build :</p>
<ol>
<li><code>llama_index/tests/graph_stores/test_simple.py</code></li>
<li><code>llama_index/tests/graph_stores/test_nebulagraph.py</code> - see how far I get, I probably won't understand what the helpers do, Wey Gu should be happy to improve</li>
<li><code>llama_index/tests/graph_stores/test_sparql.py</code></li>
<li><code>llama_index/graph_stores/sparql.py</code></li>

<p>An immediate irritation I have is that I'm coding in VSCode and also writing notes in it. Navigating between the two activities is a pain.</p>
<p>The problem is broader still because during the coding I have to do other bits of context-switch to look at/edit data, project management, bookmarks...</p>
<p>I've got most of these things at various stages of dev in HKMS, but accessing these via a browser bypasses my local FS, access there is desirable.</p>
<p>So I've been looking at Pulsar, a fork of the discontinued Atom editor. Plan is to tweak it to fit my needs.</p>
<p>I did like Atom as an editor, and hopefully as it's built on Electron it'll make a convenient local host for the HKMS apps.</p>
<p>Set up a repo : <a href="https://github.com/danja/hkms-desktop">hkms-desktop</a></p>
<p>I'm having a few teething problems with Pulsar.</p>
<p>The ppm package manager it uses is in a different repo. The install instructions didn't work for me, so playing it by ear.</p>
<ul>
<li>danny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/hkms-desktop$ ln -s ../ppm ./ppm</li>
</ul>
<p>hmm, lost the paths</p>
<pre><code>export ATOM_HOME=/home/danny/.pulsar
export APM_PATH=/home/danny/HKMS/hkms-desktop/ppm/bin/apm
export ATOM_ELECTRON_VERSION=12.2.3
</code></pre>
<p>ok, now packages seem to work.</p>
<p>Added https://github.com/denieler/save-workspace-atom-plugin
not sure it's gonna be useful...</p>
<p>Added PlatformIO IDE Terminal</p>

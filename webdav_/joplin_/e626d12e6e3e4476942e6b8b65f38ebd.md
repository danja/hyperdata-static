[20:37, 03/10/2022] Bergi: # Zero To Vocab
A Web tool could help creating vocabs based on examples. The starting point is an editor to write an example in turtle. Namespaces are optional and if they are used, it should be only external namespaces. In a second step all used properties and classes are listed. Namespace are defined in this view. Optional it's possible to group them into multiple namespaces. In a third step a vocab and SHACL shapes are shown, generated based on the namespace extended triples. All of this, the example data without namespace, the example with namespaces, the vocab, and the shape.
[20:37, 03/10/2022] Bergi: This is a part of a system I have in mind which I think is very similar to what you want to do.

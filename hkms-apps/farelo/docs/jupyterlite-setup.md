python3 -m venv jupyterlite

cd jupyterlite

source bin/activate

# bin/pip install jupyterlite-core

was struggling with that, mistyped (in separate console) 

- ah, needs new console

bin/pip install jupyterlite

- which worked?

bin/jupyter-lite build --output-dir j

...

# from https://github.com/jupyterlite/p5-kernel

bin/pip install jupyterlite-p5-kernel

bin/jupyter-lite build --output-dir j

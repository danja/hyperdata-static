# Farelo

New name for my project management stuff.

Something I've kept coming back to over the past 20 years.

A key feature is using the RDF as the underlying model.

What I want is a good strategy for _what I should do now_. To help with _getting things done_.

Everything should be very easy & intuitive to use as well as being as far as possible self-documenting in a web-friendly form. While the raw information should be publishable directly, it should also make it easy to compile a summary, formal report or blog post. The material should be rich in links to related material.

Another freshish start after a long break. I stumbled on [TurtleEditor](https://github.com/EIS-Bonn/TurtleEditor/), made by some folks from Bonn 7 years ago. It has features that make me like it as a starting point for this revision.

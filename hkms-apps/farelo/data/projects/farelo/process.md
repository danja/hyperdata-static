# Process

### Top-Level Organisation

Seems like I generally have 3 meta levels of granularity in projects :

1. Domain (eg. Outdoors, Software)
2. Project (eg. Not Climbing, HKMS)
3. Subproject (eg. Paracord, FooWiki)

I don't think I need to worry too much about 1, just #tagging is adequate.

For each of 2 I need to set up a GitHub project & a page at danja.github.io as master index. Some of 3 (depending on complexity) will probably require further subdivision, ie. treat as 2.

### Documentation

For each subproject, need:

* ```index.*```
* devlog.md

 For each **video** for each subproject, need *title* folder including :

* sketch plan, storyboard, notes : ```sketch.md```
* web page, overview, links : ```index.*```
* blog post equiv to vid

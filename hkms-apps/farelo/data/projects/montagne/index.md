This project was prompted by the paper [Electromagnetic Signals Are Produced by Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNA Sequences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45272907_Electromagnetic_Signals_Are_Produced_by_Aqueous_Nanostructures_Derived_from_Bacterial_DNA_Sequences), Luc Montagnier et al. 2009. In it the authors report the detection of electromagnetic emissions from various samples of biological origin. Additionally they hypothesize mechanisms for the source of the emissions that seem inconsistent with the relevant science. Subsequent work led to reports of ['DNA Teleportation'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_teleportation).

*According to chemist Jeff Reimers of the University of Sydney, Australia, "If the results are correct, these would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry."*

For various practical reasons the research will not be replicated directly as described in the paper. However it is considered that if the phenomena described do exist they will be readily detectable with the system to be described.

## Preliminary Discussion

Montagnier received a Nobel Prize for discovering HIV.

Resonance - unlikely because of wavelengths. Dilution results - unlikely because studies around homeopathy have not provided any credible positive results.  

## Hypothesis for the Original Results

Many years ago one of the authors used a Soundblaster soundcard (as used in the original research) for music recording in his flat in Buxton, Derbyshire. There was a taxi service nearby in the Market Place. Many recordings were disrupted by radio communications between the service and their drivers. The soundcard, despite being mounted inside a computer cabinet, was prone to receiving spurious electromagnetic signals. By the design of the interface (and subsequent processing) any spurious signals would be interpreted as being within the audio range. Shielding of the receptor coil in a VLF radio receiver would not be any protection from environmental noise further down the line.

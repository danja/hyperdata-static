Also finished the puzzle I was making for Mari. I'm very pleased with the end result, though annoyed I still can't manage to cut neat cubes. (Chestnut wood, 2cm-ish). 
Glued, a coat of linseed oil. Painted with oils with a bit of Liquin that has curdled but still seemed to speed drying. The cat side (copied image found online with a round face - "how to tell if your cat is pregnant") -  painted itself. Dog side (Sasha), I could not get right. Scrappy. But managed something good-enough over 3 or 4 sessions. Finish was very dreary matt. Bottle of painting varnish (from Caroline's mother) had also separated - tried whisking it, gloopy mess.Tried spray acrylic varnish on a scrap - worked a treat, yay!
The puzzle design - pentominoes (like dominoes, but with 5 squares), bit challenging on how best to make a puzzle that would have a little challenge.

VR

Having an always-connected interface is the obvious next step in the adoption of computers. 
Total immersion is an edge case.

We have a tendency not to notice the rate at which tech is changing because it mostly happens in small steps. Barring global disasters, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect decent wearables in the next decade, maybe a little longer for them to become generally affordable.

If you went back in time 20 years and told people "where I come from most people carry a computer in their pocket at all times", what reaction would you expect? If you went back 10 more years and added "...which is connected to a global network", what then?
You only need to go back 50 years and just having a computer at home was virtually unheard of. That's in my lifetime.

What I find weirdest is how much these developments were driven by advertising...

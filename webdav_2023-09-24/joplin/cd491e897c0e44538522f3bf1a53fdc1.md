Love the glitchy vibe.\\\n\\\nI saw the LoFi Future and nearby bits with feedback VGA-composite or whatever, and a dirty mixer somewhere. Has to be done, bits ordered. But I also had 20 year's worth of crap in the cantina to consider. Just dug it out. Still all untested, some may go boom!\\\n\\\nBut anyway, my newbie question is - has anyone got anything interesting out of a Sky box? For some reason I have 3 variants. \\\nSeems like they'd have all the output timing bits (looks like scart connectors, whatever protocol that is). Should be able to jam a signal in there somewhere..?\\\n\\\nI really am clueless, any suggestions welcome.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":796}]"

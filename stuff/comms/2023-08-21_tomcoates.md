Hi Tom,

20 years in this stuff, eek!

### Twitter archives

I just saw your tweet re. Twitter images. Good prompt for me to try another backup (usual archival, plus I aim soon to recycle such stuff in my own systems).

Do you know if it's written up anywhere how best to do backup? (And other social media sites, hmm, you have a blog don't you..?)

When dear Elon started trashing Twitter I signed up for all the alternatives I saw mentioned, but haven't actually migrated myself over to anything yet. So I'd love to hear which you've found yourself using the most.

### My online comms

Fwiw, after years of regular blogging I drifted away from that (and using a feedreader), mostly replaced with the big-name social media sites. I'd signed up for every one I heard about early on, as I'm sure you did, so a lot of contacts on them are early-adopter tech types. More recently, Twitter as above, on Facebook I have family and friends from the UK (I've now been in Italy for about 20 years), but I got a little sequence of bad news over it which has lessened any enthusiasm I had.

I stumbled onto Reddit again, apparently 3 or 4 years since I last signed up. But then I thought, the early adopter thing, and I knew Aaron quite well from IRC around the time he was there, surely I signed up there early on too? Yup. Using the same username I have on twitter _and_ a password I used across all the sites in that period of mad sign-ups (since changed!). For a while I had a 'Reddit Age' of 17 yrs, zero 'Karma'...

I've semi-consciously backed away from email,
